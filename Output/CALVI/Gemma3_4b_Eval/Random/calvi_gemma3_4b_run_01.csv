Explanation: Let's analyze the chart to determine the truthfulness of each statement:

*   **A. “2004 has more copies sold than 2003”:** Looking at the chart, the number of copies sold in 2004 (approximately 1000) is greater than the number of copies sold in 2003 (approximately 800). Therefore, this statement is true.

*   **B. ""Copies sold per year fell sharply in 2022.""**: Looking at the chart, copies sold in 2022 (approximately 700) is lower than in 2021 (approximately 900), but the drop is not “sharp” in comparison to the other years.

*   **C. “Copies sold per year has been strictly increasing since 2003.”**: The chart shows that copies sold in 2003 (approximately 800) is lower than copies sold in 2004 (approximately 1000), therefore this is false.

Since statements A and C are both true, and we must choose the *best* answer, we can select D."
