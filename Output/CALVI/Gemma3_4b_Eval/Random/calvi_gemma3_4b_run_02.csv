Explanation: Examining the chart, we can see that brand C consistently has the lowest market share across all years (2001, 2002, and 2005). Option A states that brand C has an increasing trend, which is incorrect. Option B states that brand C is higher in 2001 than in 2002, which is also incorrect. Option C suggests brand B had the largest share in 2001 compared to the others; however, brand A had the largest share in 2001. Therefore, none of the statements are true."

Explanation: The chart shows a downward trend in the number of visitors from 2000 to 2005. However, the chart does not provide specific numerical values for the number of visitors at any of those years. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether the number is increasing or decreasing. “Cannot be inferred/inadequate information” is the most accurate response."

Explanation: Looking at the graph, as the temperature increases (moving to the right), the number of bottles sold also increases. However, at 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the number of bottles sold is significantly less than 750. Therefore, the statement ""If the temperature gets higher than 100 degree Fahrenheit, then the bottles of water sold must be greater than 750"" is false."
34,CALVI,"Company A sells a board game. Assuming today is June 01, 2022, which of the following statements is true?",Line chart,"Find Correlations/Trends, Make Comparisons",2004 has more copies sold than 2003; Copies sold per year fell sharply in 2022.; Copies sold per year has been strictly increasing since 2003.; None of the above.,None of the above.,Inappropriate Aggregation,Copied sold per year fell sharply in 2022.,2004 has more copies sold than 2003,False,calvi/question34.png,45.649,"Answer: D
Explanation: Let’s analyze the chart to determine the correct answer.

*   **A. “Copies sold per year have more in 2004 than in 2003”**: Looking at the chart, the number of copies sold in 2004 (approximately 1000) is greater than the number of copies sold in 2003 (approximately 800). Therefore, this statement is true.
*   **B. “Copies sold per year fell sharply in 2022”**: The chart shows that sales in 2022 were approximately 700 copies, so sales did not fall sharply.
*   **C. “Copies sold per year has been strictly increasing since 2003”**: The chart shows sales in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.
