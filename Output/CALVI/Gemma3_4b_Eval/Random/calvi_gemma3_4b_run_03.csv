Explanation: Let's analyze the chart to determine which statement is true.

*   **A. “2004 has more copies sold than 2003”**: Looking at the chart, the number of copies sold in 2004 (approximately 1000) is greater than the number of copies sold in 2003 (approximately 800). So, this statement is true.
*   **B. “Copies sold per year fell sharply in 2022”**: The chart shows the number of copies sold in 2022 (approximately 800), and the number of copies sold in 2022 is greater than the number of copies sold in 2021. Thus, this statement is false.
*   **C. “Copies sold per year has been strictly increasing since 2003”**: Looking at the chart, the number of copies sold in 2004 (approximately 1000) is greater than the number of copies sold in 2003 (approximately 800), but the number of copies sold in 2005 (approximately 700) is less than the number of copies sold in 2004. Thus, this statement is false.

Since A, B and C are all false, the correct answer is D."
21,CALVI,"Assuming today is May 10 and given the chart below, which statement about rainfall (mm) is true for the past 14 days?",Bar chart,"Find Extremum, Make Comparisons",The amount of rainfall peaked at the end of the past 14 days.; There was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of the past 14 days.; None of the days had lower than 40mm of rainfall.; The amount of rainfall peaked at the beginning of the past 14 days.,There was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of the past 14 days.,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Order,The amount of rainfall peaked at the end of the past 14 days.,The amount of rainfall peaked at the end of the past 14 days.,False,calvi/question21.png,36.702,"Answer: D

Explanation: The bar representing store A is significantly taller than the bar for store B. This indicates that the price of the water bottle at store A is approximately twice the price at store B. 25% would be half, and 90% is far too high. 50% is half, and therefore, the best answer is 50%."
19,CALVI,Which is the trend of the survival rate as weight increases for species Z?,Scatterplot,Find Correlations/Trends,Generally increases; Generally decreases; Generally constant; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Generally increases,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,Generally decreases,Generally decreases,False,calvi/question19.png,36.370,"Answer: B.

Explanation: The chart only shows data for the last half of 2021. It does not provide any information about the first half of 2021, so it’s impossible to determine if the total number of shirts sold was higher in the first or second half."
28,CALVI,Does cell phone brand A have more than half of the total market share?,Pie chart,Make Comparisons,Yes; No; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Use of Scale Functions,"Yes, No",Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question28.png,36.799,"Answer: C
Explanation: The chart shows that brand A has a very small share (approximately 20%). 50% is twice that amount. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if brand A has more than half of the market share from the information provided."

Explanation: The chart shows a higher prevalence of “Z” (likely representing a risk factor) in NC than in AZ. Therefore, it is indeed a true statement based solely on the visual information presented in the chart. However, the question asks if it *can be inferred*, and while it is inferred, the chart itself doesn’t provide a definitive answer (True/False). It simply shows a difference in prevalence.

Explanation: Looking at the graph, the growth from 2000 to 2003 appears more rapid than the growth from 2005 to 2008. However, the chart only provides data for these specific periods and doesn't offer enough information to definitively state if growth was faster in one period compared to another. Therefore, it's impossible to definitively determine the answer."
