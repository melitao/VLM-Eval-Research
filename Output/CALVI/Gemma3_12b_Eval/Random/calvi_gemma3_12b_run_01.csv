Explanation:
Looking at the graph, the dot representing satisfaction rating at B is higher than the dot representing satisfaction rating at C, indicating a higher number of employees with that rating. The graph only depicts the number of employees at those specific points. 

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:
*   **A:** The dot at D is lower than the dot at A.
*   **C:** The dot at C is higher than the dot at B, which means the satisfaction rating *increases* as the number of vacation days increases.
*   **D:** This is incorrect because option B is true."
