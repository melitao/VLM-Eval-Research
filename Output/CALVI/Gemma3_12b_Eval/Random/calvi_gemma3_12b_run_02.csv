Cannot be inferred/inadequate information
Explanation: The chart shows a trend line representing the relationship between temperature and bottles of water sold up to a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit. We cannot extrapolate beyond the data presented in the chart to determine what would happen if the temperature exceeded 100 degrees. The relationship might change, or the data might not be applicable at higher temperatures. Therefore, it's impossible to infer the number of bottles sold at temperatures greater than 100 degrees based on the provided chart."
