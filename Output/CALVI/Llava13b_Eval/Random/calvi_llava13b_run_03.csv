15,CALVI,What is the trend of the total sales for item X from Apr to Jul?,Line chart,Find Correlations/Trends,"Decreasing, then increasing; Increasing, then decreasing; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information","Increasing, then decreasing",Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,"Decreasing, then increasing",Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,calvi/question15.png,43.230,"Answer: C. Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

Explanation: The image provided is a line graph that shows total sales for item X over a period of time from April to July, but it does not provide sufficient data points to accurately determine the trend of sales. To make an informed decision, one would need to observe at least two consecutive months where the trend is clear (either increasing or decreasing). However, based on the provided graph, only three monthly sales figures are shown: April, May, and June. Without more data points, it's impossible to definitively determine whether there was a significant change in the trend of sales between these months."

Explanation: The chart shows a general upward trend in the number of new movie releases, with some fluctuations throughout the years shown. However, it does not provide enough information to confidently determine which year had the most movies released, nor if there were more in one year than another without seeing multiple years on the graph. The best answer based on the given options is C, as it acknowledges that there were indeed more new movie releases in 1996 compared to 1995, but does not make a definitive statement about any other years or if the number of new movies released increased overall from one year to another."

Explanation: The image shows a line graph with two lines, one for store A and one for store B. The sales data for both stores is presented in numerical form at the bottom of the chart (104553 for store A and 98896 for store B). However, there are no clear indications on whether store B's sales are increasing or decreasing from January to December. It appears that the trend may be upward, but without a numerical comparison between months or a clear visual trend line, this cannot be inferred with certainty based solely on the provided information in the image."

Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

Explanation: The image shows a chart with the relationship between water temperature and bottles of water sold, but it does not provide enough information to determine if there is a direct correlation between temperature above 100°F and the number of bottles sold being greater than 750. The scatterplot indicates that there is a positive relationship between temperature and bottles sold, suggesting that as the temperature increases, the number of bottles sold also increases. However, without additional information such as the specific conditions under which these data were collected or any context about the market for water at different temperatures, it cannot be definitively concluded whether the number of bottles sold would increase by a certain amount when the temperature surpasses 100°F."
44,CALVI,What is the trend of the average price of books from 1960 to 2020 in city Z?,Line chart,Find Correlations/Trends,Generally increasing; Generally decreasing; Generally constant; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cherry Picking,Generally constant,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question44.png,47.062,"Answer: D. Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

Explanation: The image shows a line graph titled ""Average Price of Books Over Time in City 2."" However, the chart does not show any trend or pattern that can confidently determine whether the average price of books has generally increased, decreased, or remained constant over time. There are fluctuations and no clear upward or downward trends visible. Without more information or a broader context for interpreting this graph, it is not possible to definitively state the trend in the average book price from 1960 to 2020 in City 2. The best answer based on the chart alone is D. Cannot be inferred/inadequate information."

Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

Explanation: The image provided is a scatter plot showing the relationship between average daily working hours and happiness scores for two towns (A and B). There are some dots that appear to follow a negative trend, but given the number of data points and the range in which they occur, it's difficult to confidently say there is a significant negative relationship between these variables. Additionally, there are several outliers that might distort this relationship if considered separately. The presence of multiple explanatory variables (e.g., population density, age distribution, etc.) would be necessary to determine the significance and direction of the relationship accurately."
45,CALVI,"Assuming today is May 01, and half of the votes from each state for a favorite ice cream brand have been counted. The color of each state corresponds to the brand that has received the most votes in that state so far. The brand with the most number of colored states will be the most popular brand, and the results will be finalized on May 15.

Too early to say.
Explanation: The chart shows the current count of votes for each brand in various states across the United States. However, it does not indicate which brand is currently the most popular nationwide, as the image only provides a snapshot of the vote count at this particular moment. Since the count will be finalized on May 15 and we are just a few days into May, there isn't enough information to confidently determine which brand will be the most popular by that time. It would be premature to make any definitive statements based solely on this image."

Explanation: The image is a bar chart that shows the number of cars parked in three parking lots over time, but it does not have data for 2022 to accurately determine if there has been a sharp fall. In order to make an informed decision about this question, additional information from April and May of 2022 would be needed."

Answer: A. 33%

Explanation: The line graph indicates the number of visitors at Amusement Park B as a proportion of the number of visitors at Amusement Park C from May to December. The peak visitor count for Amusement Park B occurs just before the peak visitor count for Amusement Park C. This suggests that the ratio is very close to 1, which can be interpreted as approximately 50%. However, since I have been asked to choose one of the provided options and considering both A (33%) and B (67%) are within a reasonable range of what the actual number would likely be, based on the chart alone, the best answer seems to be A."

Cannot be inferred/inadequate information.

Explanation: The provided image shows a graph with two lines representing different percentages of bacteria Z detected over time, but it lacks the context to accurately determine the trend of this data from 1970 to 2020. There is no clear upward or downward movement of either line, and without additional information on what ""Z"" refers to in this context (e.g., a specific bacteria strain, a particular disease indicator), it's impossible to accurately interpret the trend based solely on the chart."
34,CALVI,"Company A sells a board game.

No
Explanation: In the provided pie chart, there are four cell phone brands represented with different colors (A, B, C, and D). Brand A has 5% of the market share, which is less than half of the total market share that appears to be distributed among all four brands. Therefore, answer choice B is correct as it indicates that brand A does not have more than half of the total market share."

Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

The image provided shows a map of the United States with color-coded regions indicating the prevalence of bacterial infectious disease risk levels. The colors represent different stages of infection rate, ranging from ""High"" to ""Low."" However, there is no specific indication given about the presence or absence of a predatory species Z, nor are locations like North Carolina (NC) and Arizona (AZ) explicitly marked on the map.

Therefore, it's not possible to make an accurate statement about whether Predatory species Z is more prevalent in NC than in AZ based solely on this image. The information provided does not support the claim that one location has a different level of prevalence for species Z compared to another."

Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

Explanation: The provided image shows a line graph with sales data over time, but the trend cannot be confidently determined without more context such as what period of time is being represented by each point on the graph or if there are any seasonal variations that would affect the overall trend. The graph only shows individual data points and does not provide enough information to accurately determine a general trend in sales over time from January to December."
9,CALVI,"Approximately, what is brand C's total sales as a proportion of brand B's total sales from Jan 01 to Mar 15?",Stacked area chart,Make Comparisons,20%; 50%; 60%; 90%,60%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,20%,20%,False,calvi/question9.png,56.540,"Based on the chart, it appears that Brand C's total sales (as shown by purple line) are a smaller proportion of Brand B's total sales (orange line) from January 1 to March 15. The purple line shows peaks and valleys, indicating fluctuating sales, while the orange line maintains a relatively steady level with only minor variations.

Given this context and the visual data provided by the chart, I would choose the answer that reflects Brand C's sales being less than half of Brand B's sales. Therefore, the best answer is:

Answer: A. 20%
Explanation: Based on the image, it appears that brand C's sales are about 20% of brand B's sales from January to March, as there is a significant gap between the peaks and valleys of the purple line compared to the steady level of the orange line."

17,CALVI,What is the trend of the growth for plant species P as the number of hours of sunlight exposure per month increases?,Scatterplot,Find Correlations/Trends,Generally increases; Generally decreases; Generally constant; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Generally decreases,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,Generally increaases,Generally decreases,True,calvi/question17.png,40.941,"Answer: D
Explanation: The chart shows a scatter plot with a large number of data points, but the overall trend does not clearly show an increasing or decreasing pattern as hours of sunlight exposure per month increases. There is variability in the growth rate across different levels of sunlight exposure, and without a clear upward or downward slope, it is difficult to infer a general trend from this chart alone. The data could be influenced by various factors such as specific environmental conditions, genetic differences between plants, or interactions with other species in the ecosystem. Therefore, it is not appropriate to choose options A or B based on this chart."

Explanation: The image shows bar graphs for the number of visitors to each train station on May 6, 2020 (Day 4). Train station B has a total of 480 visitors, while train station C has 350 visitors. To determine the proportion at station B compared to station C, we need to divide the number of visitors at station B by the number of visitors at station C. 480 ÷ 350 = 1.37, which is approximately equal to 25%. Therefore, the number of visitors at train station B as a proportion of that at train station C is about 25%."
18,CALVI,Which of the following is true about company Z?,Scatterplot,"Make Comparisons, Find Correlations/Trends",More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.; More employees have a satisfaction rating at B than those who have a rating at C.; Employee satisfaction rating decreases as the annual number of vacation days increases.; None of the above.,More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,More employees have a satisfaction rating at B than those who have a rating at C.,More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.,True,calvi/question18.png,40.458,"Answer: C
Explanation: The chart shows a positive correlation between the annual number of vacation days and employee satisfaction, with employees who have more vacation days generally having higher satisfaction ratings. This pattern is evident as employees at B (176) and D (2500) seem to have higher satisfaction ratings than those at A (564), despite having fewer vacation days annually than those at C (911). Additionally, the number of vacation days increases as you move from A to B, but employee satisfaction appears to decrease. This contradicts option A and suggests that there is a negative correlation between annual vacation days and employee satisfaction for company Z."

All three farms planted more vegetables in 2022 than they did in the previous years.
Explanation: In the chart, there is a significant increase in the total number of vegetables planted by all three farms from the year prior to 2022 (Y-1) to the year after 2022 (Y+1). This indicates that each farm has planted more vegetables in 2022 than in Y-1, suggesting an increase rather than a decrease."

Explanation: The image shows a pie chart representing household car ownership in the city of Z, with various slices corresponding to different numbers of cars per household. It indicates that 55% of households own exactly one car and 17% of households own exactly two cars. Since the percentage of households owning one car is greater than those owning two, it can be concluded that there are more households with exactly one car than those with exactly two cars."
