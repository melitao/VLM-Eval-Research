Explanation: The image shows a pie chart depicting the percentage of households in the city that own different numbers of vehicles, but it does not provide information on the exact number of households with 1 or 2 cars.

Explanation: While the chart shows a downward trend in average daily working hours for both A and B, there is no clear indication of a negative relationship between working hours and happiness score within each town. The dots are scattered with no apparent pattern that would allow us to confidently determine this relationship. The presence of outliers or other factors not captured by the chart might be contributing to the overall trend. Therefore, without additional context or more robust statistical analysis, it is not possible to conclusively determine the nature of the relationship between working hours and happiness scores in these towns based solely on this image."

The market share of brand C is on an increasing trend from 2001 to 2005.
Explanation: In the provided chart, the market share percentages for the three shampoo brands in City Y are shown. Looking at the years 2001 to 2005, we can see that brand C's market share increases from about 4% in 2001 to approximately 6% by 2005, indicating an upward trend. The other brands (A and B) show fluctuating percentages throughout the period, but there is no clear increasing or decreasing trend for either of them from 2001 to 2005. Hence, option A is the best answer based on the provided chart."

Explanation: The image provided is a line graph representing the number of visitors at an airport from 2001 to 2005, with two data points visible on the graph—one around 2000 and another slightly higher. However, based on this limited information, it cannot be definitively determined whether the number of visitors is decreasing or not. The best answer would require a more comprehensive understanding of the trend throughout the entire time frame being represented by the graph."
18,CALVI,Which of the following is true about company Z?,Scatterplot,"Make Comparisons, Find Correlations/Trends",More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.; More employees have a satisfaction rating at B than those who have a rating at C.; Employee satisfaction rating decreases as the annual number of vacation days increases.; None of the above.,More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,More employees have a satisfaction rating at B than those who have a rating at C.,More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.,True,calvi/question18.png,54.029,"The chart appears to show a positive correlation between the annual number of vacation days and employee satisfaction ratings across different companies (A, B, C). In other words, as the number of vacation days increases, so does employee satisfaction with their company. Therefore, the answer that is true about company Z is:

C. Employee satisfaction rating decreases as the annual number of vacation days increases.

This interpretation can be inferred from the fact that points on the graph for company A are above those for company B and C, indicating higher employee satisfaction with fewer vacation days in that company compared to the other two companies, which have more vacation days but lower satisfaction ratings. Additionally, company Z has a very high number of vacation days compared to the other companies (A, B, C), but also shows one of the lowest satisfaction ratings, suggesting a decrease in satisfaction as more vacation days are offered."

3,CALVI,What is the number of concert tickets sold on Aug 10 as a proportion of that on Aug 11?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,20%; 40%; 60%; 80%,80%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,60%,20%,False,calvi/question3.png,58.176,"Answer: A
Explanation: The chart shows concert tickets sold on August 10 (18,749) and on August 11 (23,597). To calculate the proportion of ticket sales from August 10 to August 11, we need to find out what percentage of the total sales on August 11 were made on August 10.

To do this, we can set up the following equation:

(August 10 sales / Total August 11 sales) x 100 = Percentage from Aug 10 to Aug 11

Substituting the given values:

(18,749 / 23,597) x 100 = 79.5%

Since the percentage is not an exact integer, the best answer in this case would be A: ""70%,"" which falls within the range shown by the options provided."

Too early to say.

Explanation: The image shows two brands, A and B, each with two colored states, but there is only one state colored for brand C. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively determine which brand will be the most popular based solely on the number of votes counted up until May 15. While brand C currently has more colored states than either A or B, we do not know if C will continue to receive the most votes in those states or if other states will be added for these brands between now and May 15. Therefore, it is too early to say which brand will ultimately be the most popular."

Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

Explanation: The provided chart shows the relationship between water temperature and the number of bottles sold at that temperature, but it does not provide a threshold for the upper limit of the temperature scale or any specific criteria that would require more than 750 bottles when the temperature is higher than 100°F. Therefore, one cannot make an accurate inference regarding whether the number of bottles sold should be greater than 750 if the temperature gets higher than 100°F based solely on this chart. Additional information would be required to determine such a threshold or relationship."

Copies sold per year fell sharply in 2022.

Explanation: The image shows a line graph that represents the number of copies sold each year for a board game sold by Company A. In the graph, there is a significant drop in sales from the previous year to the current year (2022). This indicates that the sales have fallen sharply in 2022 compared to earlier years, which does not meet the criteria of C) Copies sold per year has been strictly increasing since 2003. The other options do not accurately describe the trend shown in the graph."

This can be observed by looking at the points along the x-axis which represents the hours of sunlight exposure and the y-axis which represents the percentage increase in height per month. As the number of hours of sunlight increases, we see that there are generally more marked increases in growth, suggesting a positive correlation between sunlight exposure and growth rate for plant species P.

All three farms planted about the same amount of vegetables in 2022 as they did in the previous years.
Explanation: The chart displays the number of vegetable plants for each year by farm A, B, and C. There is a clear trend wherein all three farms have planted more vegetables over time, with an increase from year to year. However, there is no significant change in the number of plants between 2021 and 2022 for each farm. This indicates that the amount of vegetables planted in 2022 by each farm is similar to or slightly lower than the previous years, which aligns with option C being the best answer."

Explanation: The image provided is a line graph that shows the average price of books over time in City Z from 1960 to 2020. However, there are no labels indicating which city ""City Z"" is. Without this information, it's impossible to confidently determine the trend of the average book prices in this specific city. The graph does show fluctuations over time, but without knowing the location and the underlying factors that could be influencing the price of books (such as economic conditions, inflation, or changes in consumer preferences), it's not possible to make a definitive conclusion about the trend based on this image alone."

Based on this information, to determine the proportion of visitors at station B relative to station C, we need to compare their counts. On May 06, there are a total of 548 visitors between both stations.

Station A has 172 visitors and Station B has 128 visitors.

The sum of visitors for both Station A and Station B is 299, which is less than the total number of visitors at those two stations on this day (304). This suggests that there might be an additional visitor who is not part of either station. Therefore, we can calculate that the proportion of visitors at Station B compared to Station C is approximately (548 / 549) = 0.998 or nearly 1, as Station B's visitors are not fully captured in the visible data points on this chart.

Since none of the provided options accurately reflect the proportion as calculated above, the best answer to this question is ""D. 100%,"" as it indicates a perfect match between the numbers without being precisely accurate."
