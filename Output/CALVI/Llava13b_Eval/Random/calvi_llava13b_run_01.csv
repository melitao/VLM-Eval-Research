3,CALVI,What is the number of concert tickets sold on Aug 10 as a proportion of that on Aug 11?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,20%; 40%; 60%; 80%,80%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,60%,20%,False,calvi/question3.png,51.519,"The chart displays sales data for four days, showing concert tickets sold over those days. On August 10, a total of 9,586 tickets were sold, and on August 11, a total of 20,543 tickets were sold.

To calculate the proportion of tickets sold on August 10 to those on August 11:
(9,586 / 20,543) = 0.47 or approximately 47%

Therefore, the answer is C. 60%, which seems to be a mistaken interpretation rather than an actual proportion from the data in the chart. The correct choice based on this data would be D. 80%, as 9,586 divided by 20,543 equals approximately 0.47 or 47%."

Explanation: The chart shows the number of visitors at three train stations in City Z over four days from May 9th to May 12th. Train station B has the highest visitor count for those four days with a total of 3450, and train station C has the lowest visitor count among the three with a total of 870. To calculate the proportion of visitors at station B to those at station C on May 6th, we would divide the number at B (3450) by the number at C (870). This gives us a ratio of approximately 4169 visitors per visitor at station C on May 6th. As such, the proportion of visitors at train station B to those at train station C is not a whole number like 25% or 33%, but rather a non-whole number that could be considered the closest option to this proportion. Therefore, the best answer based on the provided options is A."
27,CALVI,GDP per capita for country Z grew faster from 2000 to 2003 than from 2005 to 2008.,Line chart,"Find Correlations/Trends, Make Comparisons",True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Use of Scale Functions,False,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,calvi/question27.png,43.840,"C. Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

Explanation: The image shows a graph with GDP per capita for Country Z over several years, from 2000 to 2008. However, without the actual growth rates or percentage increases for each period, we cannot definitively determine which period experienced faster growth between 2000-2003 and 2005-2008. The graph only shows that GDP per capita increased over time, but it does not provide the actual increase rates for the respective periods. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot definitively answer whether one period grew faster than the other."

Explanation: The chart shows three bars for each brand from year to year, with blue representing the percentage increase in market share and purple representing the absolute number of units sold (or the actual volume or value of sales). From 2001 to 2005, we can see that brand C's bar is generally increasing for both measures. The other two brands show different trends; brand B has a mix of increase and decrease in market share, while brand A has a more consistent increase in absolute volume sold but less growth in terms of percentage increase. Therefore, option A is the correct answer as it reflects that the market share of brand C increases over time from 2001 to 2005."

Too early to say.

Explanation: The image shows a map with three colors representing the votes for different ice cream brands. However, as of May 01 (the date provided), half of the votes have been counted, which means that some states are still missing data points or have not yet made their preferences known for the other brand(s). Therefore, it is too early to confidently determine which brand will be the most popular. It would require more information about the number and distribution of votes within each state as well as the percentage of total votes that each brand has received to make a conclusive statement about popularity."

A. There were more new movies released in 1992 than in 1994.

Explanation: In the provided image, we see a line graph showing the number of new movies released annually in City X over time. The graph shows significant spikes and fluctuations but does not indicate a trend where one year has more releases than another. Therefore, any statement about ""more"" or ""fewer"" movies being released based on this graph would be speculative.

However, if we focus solely on the years 1992 and 1994 as given in option A, it can be observed that there were more new movies released in 1992 than in 1994 by comparing the peaks of these two years."

Explanation: The image indicates that there is more prevalence of plant species Y in region E compared to region B. Therefore, it is less prevalent in region B than in C."
46,CALVI,"If the temperature gets higher than 100 degree Fahrenheit, then the bottles of water sold must be greater than 750.",Scatterplot,Make Predictions,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Concealed Uncertainty,True,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,calvi/question46.png,57.241,"C. Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

Explanation: The image shows a line graph representing the relationship between the temperature in degrees Celsius and the amount of water sold, measured in liters. The data points indicate that as the temperature rises, there is an increase in the amount of water sold. However, this does not provide enough information to determine whether the bottles of water sold would be greater than 750 if the temperature gets higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

To make such a determination, we would need data points at exactly 100 degrees Fahrenheit, as well as at other temperatures that could potentially occur above this threshold (e.g., 105 degrees Fahrenheit). Without these specific data points, we cannot determine whether the amount of water sold would be greater than 750 if the temperature reaches higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit."

Cannot be inferred/inadequate information.

Explanation: The provided image is a map showing the risk of bacterial infection for different regions across the United States. The color scale indicates varying levels of risk, with red indicating higher risks and other colors indicating lower risks. There is no reference to ""predatory species Z"" or any specific prevalence comparison between states North Carolina (NC) and Arizona (AZ). The image only provides information about the relative risk of bacterial infections in different regions of the United States, which does not allow for a conclusion about the presence of a single predator species. Therefore, it is impossible to provide an answer based on the given options because the question does not relate to the content of the image."

Explanation: Based on the provided chart, which shows the number of visitors per month at Amusement Parks B and C from May to December, we can observe that both parks have a similar pattern with ups and downs throughout the year. The visitor count for each park seems to follow a roughly symmetrical pattern, suggesting a proportionate distribution between the two parks. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the total number of visitors at Amusement Park B as a proportion of that at Amusement Park C is approximately 33%, which aligns with option A in this multiple-choice question."

Explanation: The image you provided is a scatter plot that shows the relationship between the number of hours of sunlight exposure per month (on the x-axis) and the growth rate for plant species P (on the y-axis). However, without additional context or data points, it's not possible to definitively determine the trend in growth for plant species P. The plot has many different growth rates across various sunlight exposure levels, but without clear patterns or a statistical test that can be applied to this kind of dataset, it is difficult to make any concrete conclusions about the overall trend. Therefore, based on the chart alone and the options provided, the best answer is D: Cannot be inferred/inadequate information."

To calculate the proportion of the store A's price compared to store B's price, you would take the height of the bar for store A (17) divided by the height of the bar for store B (50). This calculation gives a ratio of 17/50 or approximately 0.342.

The percentage that corresponds to this ratio is 34% because it's calculated as 100 * 0.342 = 34.2%. However, due to the limitation in multiple choice options provided, the closest option would be D (90%) as the price from store A is approximately one-third of that from store B.
