Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

The given image shows a graph of annual GDP per capita for country Z from the years 2000 to 2008. The trend in the graph indicates that the growth of GDP per capita was relatively steady throughout the period with some fluctuations, but there is no clear indication that the growth rate was faster during a specific time frame compared to another one, such as from 2000 to 2003 versus from 2005 to 2008. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say whether the GDP per capita grew faster from one period than from the other based solely on this graph."

Explanation: The image shows a graph of the total number of apples harvested per day on farm X from January 11 to January 14. There are several points on the graph, which indicates that there were fluctuations in the daily number of apples harvested during this period. However, without more information such as whether each data point represents a full day or just part of a day, it is not possible to confidently determine if there was an increasing or decreasing trend over time. Additionally, as there are only four days shown on the graph, any trends observed would be limited and might not be representative of the overall harvesting pattern. Hence, the correct answer is ""C,"" which means that the best explanation based on this chart alone is inadequate information to confidently determine a trend in apples harvested per day."

To determine the proportion as percentage, we would divide candidate A's votes by candidate B's votes and then multiply by 100. This calculation would be:

(431 / 598) * 100 = approximately 72%

Therefore, the answer to your question is C. 70%."

Explanation: The image provided shows a scatter plot of the number of hours of sunlight exposure per month on the x-axis and growth rate of plant species P on the y-axis. The plot contains many points scattered throughout the graph, indicating variability in the growth rate with the amount of sunlight exposure. There is no clear trend visible from the data provided that suggests a general increase or decrease in growth as the number of hours of sunlight exposure increases. The information presented does not support determining whether the growth generally increases, decreases, or remains constant. Therefore, the best answer based on the chart alone is option D: Cannot be inferred/inadequate information."

The image shows a graph with the relationship between water temperature and bottles of water sold, but it does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that if the temperature gets higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit, then the bottles of water sold must be greater than 750. The graph indicates some sort of correlation between temperature and bottles sold, but there are several factors at play that could influence the number of bottles sold, such as seasonal variations, consumer demand, and marketing efforts. Additionally, without more information on the nature of the data or the specific conditions under which the data was collected, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about the relationship between temperature and bottles of water sold."

Answer: A
Explanation: The image shows a scatter plot with points representing the number of vacation days per year versus employee satisfaction ratings in company Z. Option A correctly identifies that there are more employees at Company Z who have vacation days at letter D than those at letter C, as there is a larger cluster of points in this range compared to the other options. Option B suggests an incorrect interpretation based on the available data, as no single letter represents satisfaction ratings in this chart. Option C would be correct if it was indicating that employees with more vacation days have lower satisfaction ratings, but this is not the case as there are many scattered points throughout the range without a clear trend. Therefore, option A is the best answer based on the provided data from the image."

Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

Explanation: The image provided is a scatter plot showing the relationship between average daily working hours and happiness scores for two different towns, A and B. While there appears to be a negative correlation between working hours and happiness scores (i.e., as working hours increase, the happiness score tends to decrease), it's not possible to definitively conclude this from the chart alone without further information or statistical analysis. The presence of some data points that fall above the line of best fit indicates that some individuals in these towns are happier despite working more hours than others. Therefore, a conclusion about the overall relationship between average daily working hours and happiness score for each town cannot be drawn solely from this chart."
3,CALVI,What is the number of concert tickets sold on Aug 10 as a proportion of that on Aug 11?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,20%; 40%; 60%; 80%,80%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,60%,20%,False,calvi/question3.png,68.136,"The correct answer is A. 20%.

Explanation:
The chart shows the number of concert tickets sold on different dates, but we can only make a comparison between August 10 and August 11 based on the given options. On August 10, there were 8,005 tickets sold, while on August 11, there were 7,899 tickets sold. To find the proportion of August 10 to August 11 as a percentage, we can divide the number of tickets sold on August 10 by those sold on August 11:
8,005 / 7,899 = 0.9293
To convert this into a percentage, multiply by 100:
0.9293 * 100 = 92.93%
This is significantly higher than the options provided, indicating that the proportion of tickets sold on August 10 to those sold on August 11 was not 20%, but rather closer to or above 90%. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 20%."
45,CALVI,"Assuming today is May 01, and half of the votes from each state for a favorite ice cream brand have been counted. The color of each state corresponds to the brand that has received the most votes in that state so far. The brand with the most number of colored states will be the most popular brand, and the results will be finalized on May 15.

Too early to say.
Explanation: The image shows a map where the states are colored according to the ice cream brand with the most votes in each state at this point in time, which is May 01. However, it's not possible to determine which brand will be the most popular based on the current data as there might be more votes coming in from May 01 to May 15. The image does not provide information about how many total votes each brand has received across all states, nor does it show whether any of the brands have already secured a majority of total votes nationwide or if it is still too close to call. Therefore, we can only say that it's ""too early to say"" which brand will be the most popular since there are still more votes to be counted before May 15."

Cannot be inferred/inadequate information
Explanation: The image shows a scatter plot with points representing salaries for each city plotted against average daily working hours, but there is no clear trend or relationship visible between the two variables. The data appears to follow a random pattern rather than a linear or proportional relationship that would indicate a positive correlation. There are some points above and below the line of best fit, suggesting some variability in the relationship. To determine if there is a positive relationship between salary and average daily working hours within each city, more detailed analysis would be needed to discern if there is a significant correlation or not."
4,CALVI,What is the price of water bottle from store A as a proportion of that from store B?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,17%; 25%; 50%; 90%,90%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,17%,25%,False,calvi/question4.png,41.101,"Answer: B
Explanation: The chart shows the prices of water bottles in stores A and B, with store A being lower than store B. To determine the proportion of the price from store A compared to store B, you need to find the ratio between the two prices. Store A's price is 18 (approximately), while store B's price is 25. To get the proportion as a percentage, divide the lower number by the higher number and multiply by 100:

(18 / 25) * 100 = 72%

Therefore, the answer is option B, which corresponds to 72%."

Answer: A. All three farms planted more vegetables in 2022 than they did in the previous years.
Explanation: The chart shows a year-by-year comparison of vegetables planned by the three farms. In 2021, there are green boxes indicating an increase, and yellow boxes indicating a decrease or maintenance compared to the previous year. For 2022, all three farms have solid green boxes, indicating an increase in the number of vegetables planted. There is no evidence to suggest that any farm has decreased or maintained its vegetable production for this particular year. Thus, option A is the correct answer based on the provided options and the chart data."

Explanation: The chart shows that the market share for brand C is on an increasing trend from 2001 to 2005, as it starts at a lower percentage and rises steadily over time. Brands B and D have more fluctuating patterns with peaks and valleys in their respective market shares, which indicates that brand C's growth is more consistent across the years. Therefore, option A accurately represents what the chart shows about the brands of shampoo in city Y from 2001 to 2005."

Explanation: The image shows three bars representing the customer count for each month (Jan, Feb, and Mar) at Mall A in town X. If we add up the total number of customers represented by the three bars, it amounts to approximately 1200. Therefore, taking an average based on this data, we can say that the approximate average number of customers is close to 450 per month. However, there are two options provided: A and B. Option A (200) seems too low compared to the data shown, while option B (300) matches with the approximate average calculated from the chart."

Explanation: The image provided is a map showing the average amount of precipitation over 15 years in various regions around the world. Region D is depicted with a higher amount of precipitation than region C, as indicated by the color shading. However, to determine whether the average amount in region D was actually higher than that in region C for 15 years without any other information or context would be speculative and inadequate based on what I can see from the image alone. The best answer is option C, which accurately reflects the limitation of making a definite comparison between regions D and C based solely on this image."

Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

Explanation: The image shows a map with regions around the world and corresponding numbers of confirmed cases for an unknown infectious disease, but it is not clear which region has the highest number of confirmed cases per 1,000 people because the data provided does not allow for accurate calculations or comparisons between regions. Each region's data could be in a different time frame or measured differently, making direct comparison impossible. Without specific numerical values or a standardized method of measurement, it is not possible to accurately determine which region has the highest number of cases per capita."
9,CALVI,"Approximately, what is brand C's total sales as a proportion of brand B's total sales from Jan 01 to Mar 15?",Stacked area chart,Make Comparisons,20%; 50%; 60%; 90%,60%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,20%,20%,False,calvi/question9.png,42.855,"Answer: A
Explanation: The chart shows the total sales for brand B in blue from January through March, and then brand C's sales are overlaid with a dashed line starting with January and ending on March. Based on the visual representation of this graph, it appears that the dashed line (brand C) never surpasses the solid line (brand B), indicating that brand C's total sales at no point reach 50% of brand B's sales during the given timeframe. This suggests that the proportion of brand C's total sales to brand B's is less than 50%, hence the answer is A, which represents a smaller percentage of sales."

The line for Amusement Park B shows a lower and relatively fluctuating peak in October, while the line for Amusement Park C is higher with more consistent visits throughout the year.

The proportion of visitors at Park B to Park C is approximately 67%, which would be option B - 67% when compared to the total number of visitors at Amusement Park C from May to December."

Without further context, I cannot definitively say if there was a sharp decrease in 2022 compared to previous years."
5,CALVI,"On May 06 in city Z, what is the number of visitors at train station B as a proportion of that at train station C?",Stacked bar chart,Make Comparisons,25%; 33%; 75%; 100%,33%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,100%,33%,True,calvi/question5.png,65.015,"The image provided appears to be a bar graph representing the number of visitors at three train stations (A, B, and C) in City Z over a four-day period, which includes May 6th. The x-axis represents the dates, while the y-axis shows the number of visitors for each day.

Looking at the chart:
- On May 06, Train Station A has the most visitors with the highest bar.
- Train Station B has a medium blue bar on May 06, which is smaller than Train Station A but larger than Train Station C's green bar.
- Train Station C has the least number of visitors among the three stations for that day.

Based on these observations:
Answer: B
Explanation: On May 06, Train Station B has a visitor count that is approximately 33% of that at Train Station A. The blue bar for Train Station B is smaller than the blue bar for Train Station A but larger than the green bar for Train Station C, which suggests it is about one-third of Train Station A's count on that day."

Explanation: The image shows a bar chart with three hiking trails (A, B, and C) and their respective voting counts for half of the votes. Trail A has 500 votes, trail B has 400 votes, and trail C has 300 votes. It is not possible to confidently determine which trail will win based on these numbers alone since it appears that there could be a significant number of additional votes yet to be counted, which could change the outcome significantly. The exact outcome would depend on how many more votes are cast for each trail and how the distribution of those votes differs from the current count shown in the chart. Therefore, the best answer is ""D"" since it's too early to say which hiking trail will be voted as the favorite based on this limited data."
