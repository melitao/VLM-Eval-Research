Explanation: The image shows a graph with two time periods, 2000-2003 and 2005-2008. However, it does not provide the growth rate for GDP per capita in these periods or whether one period grew faster than the other. In order to accurately determine if GDP per capita grew faster from 2000 to 2003 than from 2005 to 2008, additional information about the growth rates during each time frame would be necessary for comparison."

52,CALVI,Monthly sales for store B is increasing from Jan to Dec.,Line chart,Find Correlations/Trends,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Misleading Annotation,True.,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,calvi/question52.png,37.815,"C. Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

Explanation: The chart shows monthly sales for both store A and store B, but it does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether the sales for store B are increasing from January to December. While there appears to be a general upward trend in both stores' sales, without specific data points or a clear comparison between the two stores, it is difficult to accurately assess if store B is experiencing an increase from January to December. Therefore, the best answer based on the provided options is ""C: Cannot be inferred/inadequate information."""
38,CALVI,"Within each town, is there a negative relationship between average daily working hours and happiness score?",Scatterplot,Find Correlations/Trends,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Inappropriate Aggregation,True,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,calvi/question38.png,49.960,"Answer: C. Cannot be inferred/inadequate information
Explanation: The image provided is a scatter plot showing the relationship between average daily working hours and happiness scores for towns A, B, and C. From the chart, it appears that there might be some form of negative correlation between the two variables as indicated by the points moving downwards from left to right. However, based on the data presented in this chart alone, it is not possible to confidently conclude whether the relationship is actually negative or if other factors are at play affecting these scores. Additionally, there might be individual fluctuations within each town that do not necessarily follow a clear trend. Therefore, a definitive answer based solely on the chart would require more detailed statistical analysis and consideration of confounding variables that may not be apparent from this image alone."
10,CALVI,Predatory species Z is more prevalent in NC than in AZ.,Choropleth Map,Make Comparisons,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,True,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,calvi/question11.png,34.476,"C. Cannot be inferred/inadequate information
Explanation: The provided image is a heat map showing the risk of Bubonic Plague infection across different regions within the United States, but it does not contain any information about predatory species Z or the relative prevalence between North Carolina (NC) and Arizona (AZ). Therefore, the statement ""Predatory species Z is more prevalent in NC than in AZ"" cannot be confidently inferred from this image. The correct answer would be 'C' based on the given options."
50,CALVI,"In city Z, what is the approximate average number of new buildings built from 1950 to 1952?",Scatterplot,Aggregate Values,20; 30; 40; 50,40,Misleading Annotations,30,40,True,calvi/question50.png,35.893,"Based on the chart provided, it appears that the most accurate representation of the average number of new buildings in City Z from 1950 to 1952 would be option C, as indicated by the line and the brown dots. The image shows a chart with a downward trend starting at around 20, peaking around 40, and then dropping again towards 30 at the end of this period. Option C, ""40,"" aligns more closely with the peak on the graph than options A or B."
49,CALVI,"In town X, what is the approximate average number of customers at mall A from Jan to Mar?",Bar chart,Aggregate Values,200; 300; 400; 500,400,Misleading Annotation,300,400,True,calvi/question49.png,41.224,"Answer: C
Explanation: The image shows a bar chart representing the number of customers per month at mall A in town X from January to March. The bars are colored gray and depict the actual count, with one bar per month. To determine the approximate average number of customers, we can calculate the sum of the four months and divide by four. This gives an approximate average of:
(400 + 350 + 410 + 380) / 4 = 395/4 = 99
Therefore, the answer is option C, which represents the average number of customers from January to March at mall A in town X."
28,CALVI,Does cell phone brand A have more than half of the total market share?,Pie chart,Make Comparisons,Yes; No; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Use of Scale Functions,"Yes, No",Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question28.png,30.595,"Answer: B
Explanation: The chart shows that Cell Phone Brand A has a 40% market share, and there are two other cell phone brands with 30% each. Therefore, the total market share is 100%. Since A's market share is less than half of the total (50%) and B has less than 50%, it can be inferred that Cell Phone Brand A does not have more than half of the total market share."

37,CALVI,"Assuming today is May 01, 2022, which of the following statements is true?",Area chart,"Find Correlations/Trends, Make Comparisons",Company Z had more new employees in 2018 than in 2020.; The number of new employees per year fell sharply in 2022.; The total number of employees in company Z decreased in 2022.; None of the above.,None of the above.,Inappropriate Aggregation,The number of new employees per year fell sharply in 2022.,The total number of employees in company Z decreased in 2022.,False,calvi/question37.png,51.127,"Based on the chart provided, the best answer would be C. The total number of employees in company Z has not decreased but rather fluctuated over time. There is a slight increase from around May 2021 to approximately October 2021, followed by a sharp decline afterward, and then a slight rebound again into late 2022. Therefore, there is no indication in the chart that the total number of employees in company Z has decreased in 2022 or any other year shown on the graph. Option A about more new employees in 2018 than in 2020 is not supported by the data, and option B about a sharp decline in new employee numbers in 2022 does not align with the fluctuating pattern shown in the chart. The correct answer is C."

Cannot be inferred/inadequate information
Explanation: The chart is a scatter plot with no clear trend visible due to the wide variation in growth rates across different numbers of sunlight exposure hours per month. The data points are spread out with no apparent pattern, making it difficult to confidently determine an overall trend."
23,CALVI,Is the total number of shirts sold by company Z in the first half of 2021 higher than that in the second half?,Area chart,Find Correlations/Trends,Yes; No; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,No,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Order,Yes,No,True,calvi/question23.png,7.013,B

Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

The given image is a scatter plot chart representing the relationship between weight and survival rate for species Z. There is no clear trend evident from the data points presented in this graph. The survival rate appears to be somewhat scattered across different weights, which suggests that while there might be some correlation, it's not strong enough to definitively determine a consistent trend. Therefore, the best answer based on the chart alone would be D: Cannot be inferred/inadequate information."

Explanation: In the image provided, Candidate A received 196 votes and Candidate B received 203 votes. This indicates that Candidate B received slightly more votes than Candidate A. Therefore, as a proportion of those for candidate B, Candidate A's vote count is approximately 50% of the total votes (196/203 * 100 = 96%). However, since the option ""B"" is closest to this calculation, it is the best answer based on the information provided."

Explanation: The price of the water bottle from store A is shown to be $2, which is 90% of the price from store B, which is also $2. Therefore, the proportion of the prices from store A to store B is 1 for 1 or 100%, but since we need a percentage value, 90% would be the closest approximation."

Cannot be inferred/inadequate information.
Explanation: The image shows a graph with a downward trend for the number of visitors at Airport X, starting in 2001 and going through to 2005. However, the specific details about whether the number is actually decreasing from 2000 to 2005 are not provided on the graph or its title. This information would be necessary to make a definitive statement as to whether the number of visitors is increasing or decreasing during that period, and it is therefore inadequate to make an informed choice between options A and B without this crucial detail."

More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.
Explanation: The chart shows that there are a total of 8169 employee satisfaction ratings for Company Z, with various numbers of vacation days ranging from B to C and only one data point at D. For the given number of vacation days, the employee satisfaction rating is typically higher at C than at A or B. However, since there is a single data point at D that has significantly more employees with vacation days (2149) compared to any other category, it suggests that the company has a unique policy at D where a larger number of employees are granted vacation days. Therefore, option A is true as it indicates that more employees have vacation days at D compared to those at A."

Explanation: The number of visitors at train station B is 25%, as indicated by the blue bar that represents B on the chart, and it is divided into three bars that represent different days (May 06). This shows that in City Z on May 06, 25% of the total number of visitors across all three stations was at train station B. The other two options, C and D, are not applicable because they do not accurately describe the proportion of visitors at train station B compared to those at train station C for the specific date May 06."
