4,CALVI,What is the price of water bottle from store A as a proportion of that from store B?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,17%; 25%; 50%; 90%,90%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,17%,90%,True,calvi/question4.png,20.441,"Answer: D
Explanation: The image shows the price of a water bottle for store A as $4.80 and store B as $3.60. To calculate the proportion of store A's price to store B's price, we can divide store A's price by store B's price:
$4.80 / $3.60 = 1.333333333333333

To express this as a percentage, we multiply the result by 100:
1.333333333333333 * 100 = 133.33%

So the price of store A is approximately 133.33% higher than that of store B, which can be expressed as 133.33% or 90%, rounding to the nearest whole percentage. Therefore, the correct answer is:
D. 90%"

Explanation:
Based on the chart, the number of new employees per year in Company Z fell sharply in 2022. This is evident by the sharp decline in the line graph that represents this data, indicating a significant decrease compared to previous years like 2018 and 2019."
10,CALVI,Predatory species Z is more prevalent in NC than in AZ.,Choropleth Map,Make Comparisons,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,True,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,calvi/question11.png,13.576,"Answer: B
Explanation: The image shows a map with states highlighted, and the legend indicates that the color coding represents the prevalence of predatory species Z. However, we cannot determine from this image whether predatory species Z is more prevalent in North Carolina (NC) than in Arizona (AZ). The map does not provide numerical values or specific data for each state to compare their relative levels of predatory species Z. Without such information, it's impossible to confidently choose option A or B, so the correct answer would be C: Cannot be inferred/inadequate information."
47,CALVI,More than half of the people in county Z prefer reading at night.,Pie chart,Make Comparisons,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Misleading Annotation,True.,True,False,calvi/question47.png,7.485,"Option A: True

Explanation: The chart shows two dots for each town, with the x-axis representing average daily working hours and the y-axis representing happiness scores. Both towns have higher average daily working hours (x-axis) associated with lower happiness scores (y-axis). This indicates a negative relationship between average daily working hours and happiness scores within each town."

Explanation: The image shows two bar graphs, one for candidate A and the other for candidate B. Looking at the graph for candidate A, there are a total of 150 votes counted. For candidate B, there are a total of 200 votes counted. To calculate the proportion of votes for candidate A as a proportion of those for candidate B, you would divide the number of votes for candidate A (150) by the number of votes for candidate B (200). This gives us a ratio of 0.75 or 75%. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply it by 100: 0.75 x 100 = 75%. Therefore, the answer is C, which says 70%.

This means that candidate A received approximately 70% of the votes compared to candidate B. Please note that this is a rough estimate based on the visual information provided in the image, and there may be slight discrepancies due to rounding or other factors not apparent from the graph alone."
2,CALVI,Do U.S. states have a more similar number of windy days in the summer or in the winter?,Choropleth Map,Make Comparisons,Summer; Winter; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,Winter,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question2.png,11.536,"Answer: B
Explanation: The image shows a map comparing the number of windy days in the winter and summer months across various U.S. states. According to the map, the darker green color represents more windy days, while lighter green indicates fewer windy days. It is clear from the map that there are more windy days reported in the winter months (green shades) compared to the summer months (light green shades), indicating option B as the correct answer."
36,CALVI,"Assuming today is Apr 10, 2022, did the total number of cars parked in the three parking lots fall sharply in 2022?",Stacked bar chart,Make Comparisons,Yes; No; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Inappropriate Aggregation,Yes,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question36.png,9.604,"Answer: A
Explanation: The image shows a graph with red bars, which represent the number of cars parked in three different lots on certain dates. In April 2022, there is a sharp decrease in the total number of cars parked compared to the previous month. This suggests that the total number of cars parked fell sharply during this time period."
8,CALVI,"Approximately, what is the total number of visitors at amusement park B as a proportion of that at amusement park C from May to December?",Stacked area chart,Make Comparisons,33%; 67%; 100%; 200%,33%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,200%,33%,True,calvi/question8.png,23.265,"Answer: A
Explanation: The chart shows the number of visitors for each month at amusement parks B and C over a seven-month period from May to December. Amusement park B had 8,750 visitors, while amusement park C had 14,920 visitors. To calculate the proportion of visitors at amusement park B as a percentage of those at amusement park C, you would divide the number of visitors at park B by the number of visitors at park C and multiply by 100. In this case, that calculation is (8750 / 14920) x 100 = 0.59 or approximately 60%. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 33%, as option D would be higher than the actual proportion of visitors at park B compared to park C. Option B is not the exact answer and C is more than double the number of visitors at amusement park B, which does not meet the criteria of being approximately equal to the total number of visitors at amusement park C."

25,CALVI,Which of the following is true about the three brands of shampoo in city Y from 2001 to 2005?,100% stacked bar chart,"Find Correlations/Trends, Make Comparisons, Find Extremum",The market share of brand C is on an increasing trend from 2001 to 2005.; The market share of brand C is higher in 2001 than in 2002.; Brand B had the largest market share in 2001 compared to its market share in the other years.; None of the above.,The market share of brand C is higher in 2001 than in 2002.,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Order,"The market share of brand C is on an increasing trend from 2001 to 2005., Brand B had the largest market share in 2001 compared to its market share in the other years.",The market share of brand C is on an increasing trend from 2001 to 2005.,False,calvi/question25.png,19.761,"Answer: B
Explanation: In the image, we can observe that the market share of brand C is higher in 2001 than in 2002, with a value of approximately 35%, compared to its other years shown on the chart. This is because the graph indicates that the market share for this particular shampoo brand decreases over time from 2001 to 2005. The other two brands (A and B) show increasing or stable trends during the same period, with brand A having a market share close to 60% by 2005 and brand B slightly less at around 45%.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer, as it accurately reflects that the market share of brand C is higher in 2001 compared to its other years shown on the chart."
48,CALVI,"The residents of town Y are voting on a favorite hiking trail, and half of the votes have been counted. The poll closes on Sep 01, 2022.

The chart indicates that only 50% of the votes have been counted for the three hiking trails, A, B, and C. As a result, it's too early to conclude which trail will be voted as the favorite because there are still outstanding votes that could potentially change the outcome. The results will become clearer once all the votes have been counted after Sep 01, 2022."
22,CALVI,The number of visitors at airport X is decreasing from 2000 to 2005.,Line chart,Find Correlations/Trends,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Order,True,False,True,calvi/question22.png,17.540,"B. False

Explanation: The image shows a line graph with the number of visitors at an airport increasing from 2000 to 4000 between 2005 and 2017. It is not decreasing as stated in option A. The line graph clearly illustrates an upward trend in the number of visitors at the airport over time. Therefore, option B, ""False,"" is the correct answer. Option C, ""Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,"" could be considered if there were insufficient data points or context to determine whether the number of visitors is increasing or decreasing. However, since we have a clear line graph showing an increase in visitor numbers over time, option B is the best and correct answer."
18,CALVI,Which of the following is true about company Z?,Scatterplot,"Make Comparisons, Find Correlations/Trends",More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.; More employees have a satisfaction rating at B than those who have a rating at C.; Employee satisfaction rating decreases as the annual number of vacation days increases.; None of the above.,More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,More employees have a satisfaction rating at B than those who have a rating at C.,More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.,True,calvi/question18.png,13.345,"Answer: A
Explanation: According to the chart, there are 100 employees in Company Z with zero vacation days and 95 have a satisfaction rating of D. The image also shows that there are 80 employees in Company Z who have five vacation days, and they have a satisfaction rating of C. Based on this information, it can be concluded that more employees at A (with zero vacation days) have a higher satisfaction rating than those at B (with five vacation days). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
15,CALVI,What is the trend of the total sales for item X from Apr to Jul?,Line chart,Find Correlations/Trends,"Decreasing, then increasing; Increasing, then decreasing; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information","Increasing, then decreasing",Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,"Decreasing, then increasing","Decreasing, then increasing",False,calvi/question15.png,9.861,"Answer: A
Explanation: The image shows a line graph tracking the total sales for item X over a four-month period from April to July. According to the graph, the sales start high and decrease in May before increasing again in June. This pattern suggests that there was an initial increase followed by a decline, which is consistent with option A (Decreasing, then increasing)."
3,CALVI,What is the number of concert tickets sold on Aug 10 as a proportion of that on Aug 11?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,20%; 40%; 60%; 80%,80%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,60%,80%,True,calvi/question3.png,17.118,"Answer: D
Explanation: In the image, there are two bars representing the number of concert tickets sold on Aug 10 and Aug 11. The bar for Aug 10 is shorter than the bar for Aug 11. Since a smaller portion of the bar corresponds to Aug 10 than Aug 11, it can be inferred that fewer tickets were sold on Aug 10 compared to Aug 11. Therefore, the number of concert tickets sold on Aug 10 as a proportion of that on Aug 11 is less than 100%, which corresponds to option D. The other options suggest that more or an equal number of tickets were sold on Aug 10, so they are not the correct answer."
27,CALVI,GDP per capita for country Z grew faster from 2000 to 2003 than from 2005 to 2008.,Line chart,"Find Correlations/Trends, Make Comparisons",True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Use of Scale Functions,False,True,True,calvi/question27.png,15.292,"A. False
Explanation: The line graph shows the GDP per capita for country Z over a ten year period, from 2000 to 2010. It appears that the growth rate of the GDP per capita was relatively constant throughout the entire period. There is no evidence in the image to support the statement that the GDP per capita for country Z grew faster from 2000 to 2003 than from 2005 to 2008, as it remains consistently high without any noticeable increase or decrease within the given time frame."
21,CALVI,"Assuming today is May 10 and given the chart below, which statement about rainfall (mm) is true for the past 14 days?",Bar chart,"Find Extremum, Make Comparisons",The amount of rainfall peaked at the end of the past 14 days.; There was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of the past 14 days.; None of the days had lower than 40mm of rainfall.; The amount of rainfall peaked at the beginning of the past 14 days.,There was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of the past 14 days.,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Order,The amount of rainfall peaked at the end of the past 14 days.,There was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of the past 14 days.,True,calvi/question21.png,14.030,"Answer: B
Explanation: According to the chart, there was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of the past 14 days. This is evident from the fact that the first few bars on the left side (representing the early days) are taller than the ones on the right side, indicating a higher amount of rainfall at the start. The last bar on the far right is lower in height compared to the ones before it, which suggests that the rainfall decreased as time progressed from the beginning to the end of the 14-day period. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
45,CALVI,"Assuming today is May 01, and half of the votes from each state for a favorite ice cream brand have been counted.

14,CALVI,Which of the following is true about the annual number of new movies released in city X?,Line chart,"Make Comparisons, Find Extremum",There were more new movies released in 1992 than in 1994.; 2000 had the most number of new movies released.; There were more new movies released in 1996 than in 1995.; None of the above.,There were more new movies released in 1992 than in 1994.,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,"2000 had the most number of new movies released., There were more new movies released in 1996 than in 1995.",2000 had the most number of new movies released.,False,calvi/question14.png,11.826,"Answer: B
Explanation: The chart shows a line graph that represents the annual number of new movies released in city X over several years. In the graph, there is a peak in the number of new movies released around the year 2000, which is higher than other years shown on the graph. Therefore, option B is correct as it states ""2000 had the most number of new movies released."" This conclusion is based on the visual information provided by the line chart, without any external knowledge."
46,CALVI,"If the temperature gets higher than 100 degree Fahrenheit, then the bottles of water sold must be greater than 750.",Scatterplot,Make Predictions,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Concealed Uncertainty,True,False,True,calvi/question46.png,16.300,"B. False

Explanation: The chart shows a scatter plot that plots bottles of water sold against temperature, with each point representing the number of bottles sold on a given day at a particular temperature. While there is a noticeable trend where more water is sold as the temperature increases (especially towards the right side of the chart), it does not show a clear correlation between temperature and the number of water bottles sold. The dots are scattered, with some temperatures having fewer sales than others.

Based on this information, it cannot be inferred that if the temperature gets higher than 100 degree Fahrenheit, then the bottles of water sold must be greater than 750, as the chart does not show a consistent trend or pattern that would support such a conclusion."
34,CALVI,"Company A sells a board game. Assuming today is June 01, 2022, which of the following statements is true?",Line chart,"Find Correlations/Trends, Make Comparisons",2004 has more copies sold than 2003; Copies sold per year fell sharply in 2022.; Copies sold per year has been strictly increasing since 2003.; None of the above.,None of the above.,Inappropriate Aggregation,Copied sold per year fell sharply in 2022.,2004 has more copies sold than 2003,False,calvi/question34.png,11.222,"Answer: C
Explanation: According to the chart, copies of board games sold per year have been strictly increasing since 2003, with no indication of a sharp fall in 2022 or 2004 having more copies sold than 2003. The trend line shows a consistent upward slope from left to right, suggesting that the number of copies sold has been steadily increasing over time. Therefore, option C is the correct answer."

17,CALVI,What is the trend of the growth for plant species P as the number of hours of sunlight exposure per month increases?,Scatterplot,Find Correlations/Trends,Generally increases; Generally decreases; Generally constant; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Generally decreases,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,Generally increaases,Generally increases,False,calvi/question17.png,12.207,"Answer: A
Explanation: The image shows a line graph where the x-axis represents sunlight exposure per month and the y-axis represents plant growth. The upward trend of the line suggests that as the number of hours of sunlight exposure per month increases, the growth of the plant species also generally increases. This is because plants require sunlight for photosynthesis, which is the process by which they convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. Therefore, an increase in sunlight exposure would typically lead to increased growth rates for plants."

Explanation: Based on the chart, it shows vegetable production by three different farms in 2018 and 2022. Farm A produced approximately the same amount of vegetables in both years, farm B produced more vegetables in 2022 compared to 2018, and farm C produced slightly more vegetables in 2022 than it did in 2018. Therefore, only one farm (farm B) planted fewer vegetables in 2022 than it did in the previous year, while all three farms roughly maintained or increased their vegetable production from 2018 to 2022. Therefore, option C is the correct answer."
