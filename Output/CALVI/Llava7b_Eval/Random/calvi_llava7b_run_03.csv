15,CALVI,What is the trend of the total sales for item X from Apr to Jul?,Line chart,Find Correlations/Trends,"Decreasing, then increasing; Increasing, then decreasing; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information","Increasing, then decreasing",Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,"Decreasing, then increasing","Decreasing, then increasing",False,calvi/question15.png,10.522,"Answer: A
Explanation: Based on the line graph provided, the trend of the total sales for item X from April to July appears to be a decrease followed by an increase. In April and May, there is a relatively stable level of sales, but then there is a significant drop in June, which recovers somewhat in July. This pattern suggests that the sales for item X experienced a decline followed by a rise in the following month."
3,CALVI,What is the number of concert tickets sold on Aug 10 as a proportion of that on Aug 11?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,20%; 40%; 60%; 80%,80%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,60%,40%,False,calvi/question3.png,16.056,"Answer: B
Explanation: The image shows a line graph representing the number of concert tickets sold over time. According to the chart, on Aug 10, 300 tickets were sold, while on Aug 11, 400 tickets were sold. Therefore, the proportion of tickets sold on Aug 10 as compared to Aug 11 is 300/400 = 0.75 or 75%. This falls within option B, which states that there are 20% fewer tickets sold on Aug 10 than Aug 11. However, since the options provided do not include 75%, the best answer is option B, which is 40% (the closest to the actual proportion)."
14,CALVI,Which of the following is true about the annual number of new movies released in city X?,Line chart,"Make Comparisons, Find Extremum",There were more new movies released in 1992 than in 1994.; 2000 had the most number of new movies released.; There were more new movies released in 1996 than in 1995.; None of the above.,There were more new movies released in 1992 than in 1994.,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,"2000 had the most number of new movies released., There were more new movies released in 1996 than in 1995.",2000 had the most number of new movies released.,False,calvi/question14.png,12.805,"Answer: B. 2000 had the most number of new movies released.
Explanation: According to the line graph, 2000 shows the highest peak on the chart representing the number of new movies released in city X over the years shown from 1987 to 2013. This indicates that there were more new movies released in 2000 than any other year during this period. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. The other options are not depicted on the chart or do not accurately describe the data presented."
49,CALVI,"In town X, what is the approximate average number of customers at mall A from Jan to Mar?",Bar chart,Aggregate Values,200; 300; 400; 500,400,Misleading Annotation,300,300,False,calvi/question49.png,20.309,"Answer: B
Explanation: The image shows a bar chart with two bars representing the number of customers at mall A for each month from January to March. The bars are labeled Jan, Feb, and Mar. By calculating the average value of the two visible bars, we can find an approximate average number of customers for these three months.

The value for February is 300, and the value for March is 400. To find the average, we add these two values together (300 + 400 = 700) and divide by the number of months (2). So, the average is approximately 350 customers per month.

Since option B is the closest to 350, it is the most accurate answer based on the information in the image. Option A (200) is too low, option C (400) is too high, and option D (500) is also higher than the calculated average."
52,CALVI,Monthly sales for store B is increasing from Jan to Dec.,Line chart,Find Correlations/Trends,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Misleading Annotation,True.,True,False,calvi/question52.png,13.725,"Option A: True
Explanation: The image shows a line graph with two lines, one representing monthly sales for store A and the other representing monthly sales for store B. Both lines are increasing over the ten-month period shown on the x-axis. Store B's sales increase more significantly than store A's during the first five months and then both stores show a similar pattern of increasing sales, with store A's sales reaching a peak in December while store B's continue to rise slightly. This suggests that while there is variability in their growth rates, monthly sales for store B are indeed increasing from January to December."
22,CALVI,The number of visitors at airport X is decreasing from 2000 to 2005.,Line chart,Find Correlations/Trends,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Order,True,False,True,calvi/question22.png,26.382,"Option A is correct. In the image, there is a line graph showing the number of visitors at airport X from the year 2000 to 2005. The line graph shows a downward trend in the number of visitors over the years shown, which indicates that the number of visitors at airport X is decreasing from 2000 to 2005.

Option B is incorrect. Option C is not a valid option for this question, as it does not provide any information about whether the number of visitors at airport X is increasing or decreasing. The graph only shows the number of visitors over time, but it does not provide information on whether there was an increase or decrease in the years between 2000 and 2005. Therefore, option C cannot be chosen as a valid answer based on the chart alone.

Answer: A
Explanation: The graph shows a line representing the number of visitors at airport X from 2000 to 2005. Over this period, the number of visitors decreases, which supports option A as the correct answer. Option B is incorrect because the graph does not show that the number of visitors increased over this time period, and option C is inadequate information because it does not provide any specific details about the trend of the data represented by the line graph."
50,CALVI,"In city Z, what is the approximate average number of new buildings built from 1950 to 1952?",Scatterplot,Aggregate Values,20; 30; 40; 50,40,Misleading Annotations,30,30,False,calvi/question50.png,19.624,"Answer: B
Explanation: In city Z, the approximate average number of new buildings built from 1950 to 1952 is approximately 30. This is because the chart shows that there were a total of 60 buildings constructed during these three years, and dividing this by 3 (the number of years) gives an average of roughly 20 buildings per year. However, if we look closely at the chart, it becomes evident that the data points for the first two years are closer together than those for the third year, which suggests a higher rate of construction during the first two years compared to the third year. Therefore, the average number of new buildings built from 1950 to 1952 is closer to the second data point (which represents the second year) than the first or third data points. The second data point is approximately 30 buildings, so the approximate average is also 30."
13,CALVI,What is the trend of the number of bookstores in city Z from 2000 to 2020?,Bar chart,Find Correlations/Trends,Increasing; Decreasing; Constant,Increasing,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,Decreasing,Decreasing,False,calvi/question13.png,9.691,"Answer: B
Explanation: The image shows a graph with the number of bookstores on the x-axis and years on the y-axis. There is a clear downward trend in the number of bookstores over the years, indicating that it has been decreasing from 2000 to 2020.

Explanation: The image shows a chart with a pie chart representing the time of day for people's reading preferences, and a bar graph showing the percentage of days for morning, daytime, and nighttime readings. However, there is no option to count nighttime readings as more than half of the total population's preference. Therefore, it cannot be inferred from the given information whether more than half of the people prefer reading at night or not."

16,CALVI,Which is the trend of the total number of apples harvested in farm X from Jan 11 to Jan 14?,Area chart,Find Correlations/Trends,"Increasing, then decreasing; Decreasing, then increasing; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information","Decreasing, then increasing",Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,"Increasing, then decreasing","Increasing, then decreasing",False,calvi/question16.png,16.360,"Answer: A
Explanation: The chart shows that the total number of apples harvested starts at 908 and decreases each day (Jan 11, Jan 12, and Jan 13). On Jan 14, there is a slight increase in the total number of apples harvested. This trend aligns with option A: Increasing, then decreasing.

Based on the provided information, it is not possible to confidently determine if the trend will continue to decrease or start increasing again after Jan 14. Therefore, options B and C are incorrect as they describe different trends. Option C is not applicable because external knowledge or additional data points would be needed to make an accurate assessment of the harvested apples beyond Jan 14."

No
Explanation: The chart shows that the number of cars parked on Apr 10, 2022 is lower than the number of cars parked on Apr 10, 2021. However, it does not show a sharp drop in the total number of cars parked across the three lots. Instead, the number of cars in all three lots appears to have fallen slightly compared to the previous year. The chart does not provide enough information to confidently determine if there was a significant or gradual decline in parking lot occupancy levels throughout the year, as it only shows specific data points from different time periods."
40,CALVI,Does any members of species C weigh more than 5 lbs?,Scatterplot,Retrieve Value,Yes; No; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Overplotting,No,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question40.png,13.538,"Answer: A
Explanation: In the weight versus speed for four species chart, there is a visible data point that exceeds 5 lbs in weight for the third species from the left (species C), which corresponds to purple dots. This means that at least one individual of species C weighs more than 5 lbs.

Choices B and C are not applicable in this case, as they do not provide a clear answer based on the information presented in the chart. A is the correct answer because it aligns with the data point shown for species C's weight distribution on the graph."

8,CALVI,"Approximately, what is the total number of visitors at amusement park B as a proportion of that at amusement park C from May to December?",Stacked area chart,Make Comparisons,33%; 67%; 100%; 200%,33%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,200%,33%,True,calvi/question8.png,20.980,"Answer: A
Explanation: The image is a graph showing the number of visitors at three amusement parks over six months. Park B has a total of approximately 45,000 visitors from May to December, while Park C has a total of 120,000 visitors for the same time period. To find the proportion of visitors at Park B as compared to Park C, you divide the number of visitors at Park B by the number of visitors at Park C:

45,000 / 120,000 = 37.5%

So, the total number of visitors at amusement park B is approximately 37.5% of that at amusement park C from May to December. Option A, which states ""33%,"" is not correct, as it is not equal to 37.5%. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Options B and D are also not correct, as they are more than 37.5%. The correct answer is option A."
26,CALVI,"Approximately, what is the number of votes for candidate A as a proportion of those for candidate B?",Bar chart,Make Comparisons,50%; 60%; 70%; 80%,80%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Use of Scale Functions,50%,80%,True,calvi/question26.png,12.719,"Option D: 80%.

Explanation: To calculate the proportion of votes for candidate A as a proportion of those for candidate B, we need to divide the number of votes for candidate A by the total number of votes and multiply by 100. From the bar chart provided, candidate A received 400 votes while candidate B received 500 votes. Therefore, the proportion is calculated as follows:

(400 / (400 + 500)) \* 100 = 80%."
30,CALVI,Was the average amount of precipitation over 15 years in region D higher than that in region C?,Choropleth Map,Make Comparisons,Yes; No; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Missing Data,Yes,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question30.png,13.914,"Answer: B
Explanation: The image shows a map with two regions labeled as A and B, each with precipitation data over 15 years. Region D is not included in the options, so I cannot choose it. Therefore, based on the available information, we can only compare regions A and B to determine which one has higher average precipitation. In region A, the average precipitation amount is 700 millimeters/year, while in region B, it is 1500 millimeters/year. Therefore, the answer is B, as region B has a higher average annual precipitation than region A."

Explanation: The chart shows an upward trend in copies of the board game sold each year, with a significant increase in sales from 2003 to 2004. Therefore, option C is true, as it correctly describes the trend shown in the image. Option A is not true because while there is an increase in sales between 2003 and 2004, the data does not show that the number of copies sold in 2004 was higher than those in 2003. Option B is also not true, as the trend shown in the image does not indicate a sharp decline in sales for 2022 compared to previous years. Finally, option D is incorrect since at least one of the statements (C) is true based on the information provided by the chart."
21,CALVI,"Assuming today is May 10 and given the chart below, which statement about rainfall (mm) is true for the past 14 days?",Bar chart,"Find Extremum, Make Comparisons",The amount of rainfall peaked at the end of the past 14 days.; There was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of the past 14 days.; None of the days had lower than 40mm of rainfall.; The amount of rainfall peaked at the beginning of the past 14 days.,There was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of the past 14 days.,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Order,The amount of rainfall peaked at the end of the past 14 days.,The amount of rainfall peaked at the end of the past 14 days.,False,calvi/question21.png,10.028,"Answer: A
Explanation: According to the bar chart, the amount of rainfall peaked at day 14 with a value of 90 mm, which is the highest point on the chart. Therefore, the statement ""The amount of rainfall peaked at the end of the past 14 days"" is true. The other options are not correct based on the information provided in the chart."
4,CALVI,What is the price of water bottle from store A as a proportion of that from store B?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,17%; 25%; 50%; 90%,90%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,17%,50%,False,calvi/question4.png,13.818,"Answer: C
Explanation: The image shows a water bottle price at two different stores. Store A's price is 8 dollars and Store B's price is 16 dollars. To find the proportion of the price at Store A compared to Store B, you would divide the cost of Store A by the cost of Store B.

8 dollars / 16 dollars = 0.5 (which can be expressed as 50%)

So the correct answer is C: 50% because the proportion of Store A's price to Store B's price is 0.5 or 50%."
19,CALVI,Which is the trend of the survival rate as weight increases for species Z?,Scatterplot,Find Correlations/Trends,Generally increases; Generally decreases; Generally constant; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Generally increases,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,Generally decreases,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,calvi/question19.png,11.332,"Option D is correct: ""Cannot be inferred/inadequate information.""

The image provided does not have a clear trend of the survival rate as weight increases for species Z because there are only two dots on the graph, which is insufficient data to draw any conclusions about the trend. The chart appears to show weight and survival rate for two different species (Z), but without more information or data points, it's not possible to determine if there is a relationship between these variables."
23,CALVI,Is the total number of shirts sold by company Z in the first half of 2021 higher than that in the second half?,Area chart,Find Correlations/Trends,Yes; No; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,No,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Order,Yes,No,True,calvi/question23.png,14.213,"B.

Explanation: The image shows a line graph tracking the number of shirts sold by company Z on a monthly basis from January 2021 to June 2021. There is a peak in sales in April, with numbers dropping off in May and remaining relatively flat in June. In contrast, there is a sharp increase in sales from July to September, and then another spike in October. Based on this information, it appears that the number of shirts sold by company Z in the second half (July-September) is higher than in the first half (January-April).

According to the bars in the chart, there are 400 visitors at train station B (blue bar) and 800 visitors at train station C (green bar). Therefore, visitors at train station B as a proportion of those at train station C would be calculated as follows:

(400 / 800) x 100 = 50%

However, since the question asks for the number of visitors at train station B as a proportion of that at train station C on May 06, and we know there are only three days shown in the image (May 4, May 5, and May 6), the correct answer is A: ""25%"" because it is on one particular day (May 6) when fewer visitors were at train station B compared to train station C."

27,CALVI,GDP per capita for country Z grew faster from 2000 to 2003 than from 2005 to 2008.,Line chart,"Find Correlations/Trends, Make Comparisons",True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Use of Scale Functions,False,False,False,calvi/question27.png,31.115,"B. False

Explanation: The image shows a line graph displaying the annual GDP per capita for country Z, which is measured in thousands of dollars. According to the graph, the GDP per capita for country Z grew at a faster rate from 2000 to 2003 than it did from 2005 to 2008. The graph indicates that the GDP per capita increased from around 19,000 in 2000 to approximately 26,000 in 2003, and then decreased slightly by around 7,000 before increasing again to just over 25,000 by the year 2008. As a result, based on the chart, option B is not correct because the GDP per capita did not grow faster from 2005 to 2008 than it did from 2000 to 2003. Option A is incorrect because it is not in line with the information provided by the graph. The Cannot be inferred/inadequate information option is also not correct, as there isn't insufficient information to make an accurate determination about the growth rate of GDP per capita for country Z during the period from 2005 to 2008. Therefore, the correct answer is B. False.
