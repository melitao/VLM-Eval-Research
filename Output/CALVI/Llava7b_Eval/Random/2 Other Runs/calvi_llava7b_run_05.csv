Explanation: The chart shows a positive correlation between temperature and water bottles sold, with the temperature on the x-axis and the number of water bottles sold on the y-axis. The line is a straight line going through the points plotted. It appears that as the temperature increases, the number of water bottles sold also increases. However, there is no information provided about how the temperature above 100 degrees Fahrenheit affects water bottle sales, so it cannot be determined whether or not this condition is true. The chart does not provide a clear indication of what happens to water bottle sales when the temperature is higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

The image shows a line graph that represents the relationship between the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and the number of bottles of water sold, with dots indicating data points. The line graph shows an increasing trend as the temperature rises. The chart does not provide specific values for the temperature or the number of water bottles sold at those temperatures."

Explanation: In the provided image, the line graph shows the daily rainfall in millimeters over a period of 14 days with the dates on the horizontal axis and the rainfall on the vertical axis. The rainfall fluctuates throughout the 14 days, and it is evident that there was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of this timeframe. For example, on May 2, the rainfall reaches a peak at 60mm, while on May 10, the last day in the graph, the rainfall is only at 40mm. Therefore, option B is correct, as it states ""There was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of the past 14 days."""

Explanation: The graph depicts two different sets of data plotted on the same chart. One set represents average daily working hours, while the other represents happiness scores for each town. According to the trend shown in the graph, as the average daily working hours increase, the happiness score decreases. This indicates a negative relationship between these two variables, which is in line with option A - ""True""."
3,CALVI,What is the number of concert tickets sold on Aug 10 as a proportion of that on Aug 11?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,20%; 40%; 60%; 80%,80%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,60%,60%,False,calvi/question3.png,14.093,"Answer: C
Explanation: Based on the chart, there were 400 tickets sold on Aug 10 and 800 tickets sold on Aug 11. To find the proportion of tickets sold on Aug 10 as a proportion of those on Aug 11, we divide the number of tickets sold on Aug 10 by the number of tickets sold on Aug 11.

Explanation: The image shows a line graph plotting the annual number of new movies released from 1992 to 2008 in City X. By examining the chart, it is clear that there were more new movies released in 2000 than in any other year. This aligns with option B, which states that ""2000 had the most number of new movies released."" The graph shows a peak at around 30 movies released, indicating that this was indeed the case. Therefore, the correct answer is B: ""2000 had the most number of new movies released."""

4,CALVI,What is the price of water bottle from store A as a proportion of that from store B?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,17%; 25%; 50%; 90%,90%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,17%,50%,False,calvi/question4.png,16.894,"Answer: C
Explanation: The image shows a bar chart with two water bottle prices, one for store A and another for store B. The price for store A is represented by a blue bar at the height of 6, while the price for store B is represented by a red bar at the height of 12. To find the proportion of the price for store A compared to store B, we need to divide the price for store A (6) by the price for store B (12).

Price of water bottle from store A as a proportion of that from store B = 6/12 = 0.5 or 50%

Therefore, the answer is option C: 50%. The other options are not accurate representations of the data presented in the chart."

Explanation: From the image, we can see that the total number of visitors at amusement park B from May to December is approximately 590, while the total number of visitors at amusement park C during the same period is around 1730. Therefore, the proportion of visitors at amusement park B compared to amusement park C is 590 / 1730 = 34.7% or approximately 33%.

Select your answer: A
Confidence level: 95%
Explanation: The image provides a line graph showing the number of visitors at two amusement parks, Amusement Park A and Amusement Park B, over a period from May to December. By using the scale on the y-axis (number of visitors) and the x-axis (months), we can determine that during this timeframe, there were 1730 visitors in total at amusement park C. In contrast, amusement park B had around 590 visitors. To find the proportion, you divide the number of visitors at Amusement Park B by the number of visitors at Amusement Park C. In this case, the proportion is approximately 33%. Option A is the correct answer. Options B and D are incorrect because they do not match the actual data shown in the graph.
