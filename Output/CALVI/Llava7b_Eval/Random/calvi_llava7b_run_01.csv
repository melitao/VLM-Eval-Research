3,CALVI,What is the number of concert tickets sold on Aug 10 as a proportion of that on Aug 11?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,20%; 40%; 60%; 80%,80%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,60%,80%,True,calvi/question3.png,32.448,"Answer: D, 80%
Explanation: The chart displays the number of concert tickets sold over a four-day period from Aug 7 to Aug 11, with each day represented by a different colored bar. On Aug 10, there were 943 tickets sold, and on Aug 11, there were 827 tickets sold. To find the proportion of tickets sold on Aug 10 compared to those sold on Aug 11, we need to divide the number of tickets sold on Aug 10 by the number of tickets sold on Aug 11 and then multiply the result by 100.

943/827 * 100 = 1143 / 827 * 100 ≈ 13976 / 827 * 100 ≈ 17053.84 / 827 * 100 ≈ 2109.49%

Since the percentage must be less than or equal to 100, the correct answer is:

D) 80% (which is within the given range of the chart)

Options A and B are incorrect because they represent percentages greater than 100, while option C is not a multiple of 4 from any combination of Aug 7, 8, or 9."

48,CALVI,"The residents of town Y are voting on a favorite hiking trail, and half of the votes have been counted. The poll closes on Sep 01, 2022. Which of the following is true?",Bar chart,Make Predictions,Hiking trail A will be voted as the favorite trail.; Hiking trail B will be voted as the favorite trail.; Hiking trail C will be voted as the favorite trail.; Too early to say.,Too early to say.,Concealed Uncertainty,Hiking trail A will be voted as the favorite trail.,Too early to say.,True,calvi/question48.png,12.585,"Answer: D. Too early to say.

Explanation: Based on the image, it is clear that only half of the votes have been counted for the poll. Since there is a significant amount of time left before the poll closes, it is not possible to determine which hiking trail will be voted as the favorite at this point in time. The results could change as more people cast their votes leading up to Sep 01, 2022. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
18,CALVI,Which of the following is true about company Z?,Scatterplot,"Make Comparisons, Find Correlations/Trends",More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.; More employees have a satisfaction rating at B than those who have a rating at C.; Employee satisfaction rating decreases as the annual number of vacation days increases.; None of the above.,More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,More employees have a satisfaction rating at B than those who have a rating at C.,More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.,True,calvi/question18.png,15.818,"Answer: C
Explanation: The chart shows the relationship between the annual number of vacation days and employee satisfaction rating for three different companies, labeled A, B, and D. The plot reveals a negative correlation between the two variables, meaning as the annual number of vacation days increases, the employee satisfaction rating tends to decrease. This supports option C, which states ""Employee satisfaction rating decreases as the annual number of vacation days increases."" Option A is incorrect because there isn't enough information from the chart to confirm if more employees at company D have vacation days than those at company A. Option B is also incorrect because it does not accurately describe the relationship between the annual number of vacation days and employee satisfaction rating shown in the chart."

50,CALVI,"In city Z, what is the approximate average number of new buildings built from 1950 to 1952?",Scatterplot,Aggregate Values,20; 30; 40; 50,40,Misleading Annotations,30,30,False,calvi/question50.png,17.047,"Answer: B
Explanation: The chart shows a line graph with the number of new buildings on the y-axis and years from 1950 to 1952 on the x-axis. In this time period, there are two data points visible on the graph – one representing 1950 and another representing 1951. There is no data point for 1952 on the graph. Therefore, based solely on the information provided in the chart, it is not possible to determine the approximate average number of new buildings built from 1950 to 1952 as there are only two visible data points and no information about the value in 1952.
Select D: Cannot determine with the given information"

Explanation: The graph shows that the number of customers for Mall A is at a plateau in January and February, with two bars representing these months having an average value between 400-500. In March, there is a significant increase in customer traffic, bringing the average closer to 500. Therefore, the approximate average number of customers at Mall A from Jan to Mar would be around 500."
47,CALVI,More than half of the people in county Z prefer reading at night.,Pie chart,Make Comparisons,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Misleading Annotation,True.,True,False,calvi/question47.png,24.693,"A. True
Explanation: The image shows a pie chart with the title ""PREFERRED TIME FOR READING FOR PEOPLE IN Z COUNTY Z"". According to the chart, approximately 57% of people in the county prefer reading at night. This is more than half of the population in the county, so the statement ""More than half of the people in county Z prefer reading at night"" can be considered true based on the information presented in the chart.

B. False
Explanation: The pie chart does not support this answer as it shows that a majority of people in the county prefer reading at night, which would make this statement false.

C. Cannot be inferred/inadequate information
Explanation: This option is not applicable here because the information provided in the chart is sufficient to determine whether more than half of the people in the county prefer reading at night or not. The pie chart shows the percentage distribution of reading preferences among the population of the county, and based on this data, we can conclude that more than half of the people prefer reading at night.

So, the best answer to the question is:
A. True"

Decreasing, then increasing

Explanation: The image shows a line graph representing the total sales for item X over four months (April to July). The graph indicates that there was a decrease in total sales from April to May, followed by an increase in June and July. This pattern aligns with option A, which describes a decrease in sales followed by an increase. Option B is not entirely accurate as the sales decreased only once between April and July, rather than twice, making it incorrect. Option C is also incorrect because there is enough information present in the chart to confidently determine the trend of total sales for item X during that time period."

Explanation: The image shows two bar graphs representing the number of visitors at different train stations in city Z on May 06. According to the graph, there were approximately 400 visitors at train station B and around 1600 visitors at train station C. Therefore, the proportion of visitors at train station B is approximately 25%, not 33% or 75%. The other option (D) is incorrect as it does not reflect a specific number of visitors but rather an absolute comparison between the two stations, which has already been answered."

Explanation: Based on the chart provided, the market share of brand C is indeed increasing from 2001 to 2005. The chart shows a line graph that illustrates the trend of the market share of three different brands in city Y over five years, from 2001 to 2005. The line representing brand C (in purple) increases steadily across all five years, indicating an increasing trend in its market share. Option A is correct because it describes the trend shown in the chart for brand C.

Options B and C are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the trend shown in the chart. Option D is not applicable as it does not provide any specific information about the brands or their market shares during these years."

The image provided is a chart that shows the average price of books over time in City Z, but it does not include the years 1960 and 2020 on the x-axis, making it impossible to determine the trend of book prices for those specific years from this image alone. The information about the years before 1985 is also not fully visible, which would make it difficult to infer a trend for the entire time period depicted in the chart. To accurately assess the trend of book prices from 1960 to 2020, one would need access to complete data that includes those years."

Explanation: The image shows a line graph displaying temperature versus bottles of water sold. The graph indicates that as the temperature rises, the number of bottles of water sold also increases until it reaches approximately 750. After this point, the number of bottles sold starts to decrease with a slight upturn towards the right end of the graph. However, there is no indication on the graph that if the temperature goes higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the number of bottles sold will increase significantly beyond 750. Based on this information, the answer is false because the graph does not show that sales will be greater than 750 when the temperature is above 100 degrees Fahrenheit."

Assuming today is June 01, 2022, which of the following statements is true?",Line chart,"Find Correlations/Trends, Make Comparisons",2004 has more copies sold than 2003; Copies sold per year fell sharply in 2022.; Copies sold per year has been strictly increasing since 2003.; None of the above.,None of the above.,Inappropriate Aggregation,Copied sold per year fell sharply in 2022.,Copies sold per year has been strictly increasing since 2003.,False,calvi/question34.png,16.419,"Answer: C. Copies sold per year has been strictly increasing since 2003.
Explanation: In the provided chart, there is a clear upward trend in the number of board games sold from 2003 to 2022. The graph shows that the sales have consistently increased over the years, which supports option C. It's important to note that we can only analyze data up to June 01, 2022, and the trend could change in the future. Therefore, it is not possible to predict if there will be a decrease in the future or if the sales will continue to increase. However, based on the visible data from the chart, the best answer is C."
38,CALVI,"Within each town, is there a negative relationship between average daily working hours and happiness score?",Scatterplot,Find Correlations/Trends,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Inappropriate Aggregation,True,False,True,calvi/question38.png,21.402,"B. False
Explanation: The chart shows two scatter plots with different sets of data points, indicating the relationship between average daily working hours and happiness scores for towns A and B. There are no negative relationships evident from the given graph. Instead, there appears to be a positive relationship for both towns, as indicated by the correlation coefficients provided next to each plot (0.76 for town A and 0.52 for town B). The higher the average daily working hours in each town, the higher the happiness score is generally. Therefore, option B, ""False,"" is the correct answer, as there is no negative relationship depicted within each town between average daily working hours and happiness score.

A. True would be incorrect because it suggests a negative relationship when the data presented does not support that conclusion. Cannot be inferred/inadequate information would also be incorrect since the provided data points are sufficient to determine whether there is a negative relationship or not."
16,CALVI,Which is the trend of the total number of apples harvested in farm X from Jan 11 to Jan 14?,Area chart,Find Correlations/Trends,"Increasing, then decreasing; Decreasing, then increasing; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information","Decreasing, then increasing",Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,"Increasing, then decreasing",Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,calvi/question16.png,19.014,"Answer: B
Explanation: The chart shows a line graph that represents the total number of apples harvested at farm X from January 11 to January 14. From what I can observe in the graph, the number of apples harvested starts off high and decreases over time, following a downward trend until it reaches a low point by January 13, then begins to increase again by January 14. This pattern is consistent with option B, which describes a decrease, followed by an increase in the total number of apples harvested. Option A is incorrect because there is no evidence of the number of apples increasing after it has decreased initially. Option C cannot be inferred from the available information as it does not represent a clear trend based on the chart."
52,CALVI,Monthly sales for store B is increasing from Jan to Dec.,Line chart,Find Correlations/Trends,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Misleading Annotation,True.,True,False,calvi/question52.png,17.469,"A. True

Explanation: The image shows a line graph with two lines representing the monthly sales for stores A and B over the course of a year, from January to December. Both lines show an increase in sales as we move from January to December. Store A starts with higher sales and has consistently higher sales throughout the year, while store B starts with lower sales but also shows an increase in sales each month until it surpasses store A's sales in December. The data presented in the graph does not provide a reason for the increase in sales, so we cannot confidently infer any underlying cause or context of the increased sales; however, the trend itself is clear."
2,CALVI,Do U.S. states have a more similar number of windy days in the summer or in the winter?,Choropleth Map,Make Comparisons,Summer; Winter; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,Winter,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question2.png,13.202,"Answer: B
Explanation: The chart displays two maps representing the number of windy days in the summer and winter across different U.S. states. By comparing the visual representation of the data, it is evident that there are more windy days in the winter as indicated by the higher shaded areas on the map for the winter months compared to the summer months. Therefore, the answer is B.

This conclusion is based on the visible patterns on the chart without considering any external knowledge or assumptions."
19,CALVI,Which is the trend of the survival rate as weight increases for species Z?,Scatterplot,Find Correlations/Trends,Generally increases; Generally decreases; Generally constant; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Generally increases,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,Generally decreases,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,calvi/question19.png,11.001,"D. Cannot be inferred/inadequate information
Explanation: The image provided is a scatter plot of the survival rate for species Z as weight increases, but it does not show any clear trend or pattern that would allow us to confidently determine if the survival rate generally increases, decreases, or remains constant. Without more context or additional data points, we cannot accurately infer the trend in this image."
35,CALVI,"Assuming today is Feb 20, 2022, which of the following is true about the vegetables planted by the three farms?",Stacked bar chart,Make Comparisons,All three farms planted more vegetables in 2022 than they did in the previous years.; All three farms planted fewer vegetables in 2022 than they did in the previous years.; All three farms planted about the same amount of vegetables in 2022 as they did in the previous years.; None of the above.,None of the above.,Inappropriate Aggregation,All three farms planted fewer vegetables in 2022 than they did in previous years.,All three farms planted about the same amount of vegetables in 2022 as they did in the previous years.,False,calvi/question35.png,11.299,"Answer: C
Explanation: Based on the image provided, all three farms appear to have planted roughly the same amount of vegetables in 2022 as they did in the previous years. The bar graph shows that each farm planted between 950 and 1000 vegetables, with no noticeable difference in the number of vegetables planted between 2022 and previous years. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer."
4,CALVI,What is the price of water bottle from store A as a proportion of that from store B?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,17%; 25%; 50%; 90%,90%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,17%,90%,True,calvi/question4.png,16.532,"Answer: D
Explanation: The image provided is a chart showing the price of water bottles in stores A and B. Store A has priced their bottles at $1 per bottle, while store B has priced them at $3 per bottle. To find out the proportion of the price of water bottles from store A to that from store B, we can divide the price of water bottles from store A by the price of water bottles from store B:

$1 / $3 = 0.33 (rounded)

The closest option is D with 90%, which is not an accurate representation of the proportion shown in the chart. Therefore, the correct answer is A with 17%, as it is the nearest approximation to the actual proportion."
22,CALVI,The number of visitors at airport X is decreasing from 2000 to 2005.,Line chart,Find Correlations/Trends,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Order,True,False,True,calvi/question22.png,15.382,"B. False

Explanation: The chart shows the number of visitors at an airport over a period of time, starting from 2000 and going to 2005. According to the chart, the number of visitors has increased steadily from 2000 to 2004, with a peak in 2004 at 3719 visitors, and then decreases slightly in 2005 to 3668 visitors. Therefore, it is not true that the number of visitors is decreasing from 2000 to 2005; rather, there is a slight decrease from the peak year of 2004."
1,CALVI,Do U.S. states have a more similar number of sunny days in the summer or in the winter?,Choropleth Map,Make Comparisons,Summer; Winter; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,Summer,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question1.png,18.559,"Answer: A
Explanation: The image shows two maps with data about the number of sunny days in a summer and winter season. According to the legend on the left, red shades represent more than 70% sunny days, while blue shades represent less than 30% sunny days. In both seasons, there are more states that have more than 70% sunny days (red regions) compared to those with less than 30% sunny days (blue regions). Since the legend indicates that red represents more, and there is a larger number of red areas in summer, it can be concluded that U.S. states generally have a more similar number of sunny days in summer compared to winter.
