3,CALVI,What is the number of concert tickets sold on Aug 10 as a proportion of that on Aug 11?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,20%; 40%; 60%; 80%,80%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,60%,40%,False,calvi/question3.png,20.803,"Answer: B
Explanation: The bar chart shows the number of concert tickets sold over a four-day period, from Aug 10 to Aug 13. On Aug 10, there were 95 concert tickets sold, while on Aug 11, there were 284 concert tickets sold. To find the proportion of tickets sold on Aug 10 as compared to Aug 11, we divide the number of tickets sold on Aug 10 (95) by the number of tickets sold on Aug 11 (284). 

So, the proportion is: 95/284 = 0.34 or 34%. This does not match any of the provided options, but we are only considering options A through D based on the image. Therefore, the closest option to the calculated proportion (0.34) is B.

Explanation: As of the date on the image (Aug 29, 2022), only half of the votes have been counted. The poll closes on Sep 01, so it is too early to determine which hiking trail will be voted as the favorite trail."
18,CALVI,Which of the following is true about company Z?,Scatterplot,"Make Comparisons, Find Correlations/Trends",More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.; More employees have a satisfaction rating at B than those who have a rating at C.; Employee satisfaction rating decreases as the annual number of vacation days increases.; None of the above.,More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,More employees have a satisfaction rating at B than those who have a rating at C.,More employees have vacation days at D than those at A.,True,calvi/question18.png,10.763,"Answer: C
Explanation: The chart shows a correlation between the number of vacation days and employee satisfaction ratings for Company Z. It appears that as the number of vacation days increases, the satisfaction rating decreases. This aligns with option C. Option A is incorrect because there is no information provided about the number of employees at D compared to those at A. Option B is incorrect because the chart does not show comparative employee satisfaction ratings for options B and C."

50,CALVI,"In city Z, what is the approximate average number of new buildings built from 1950 to 1952?",Scatterplot,Aggregate Values,20; 30; 40; 50,40,Misleading Annotations,30,50,False,calvi/question50.png,13.498,"Option D: ""50""
Explanation: According to the image, there are two points on the chart representing new buildings in city Z from 1950 to 1952, and they are located right below the average line. The average line is drawn in black, so it represents an average value of new buildings per year from that time period. Since both data points fall directly under the average line, it can be concluded that their combined values (1+1) equal the average number of new buildings built during that time period. Therefore, the answer is option D, which is ""50""."
49,CALVI,"In town X, what is the approximate average number of customers at mall A from Jan to Mar?",Bar chart,Aggregate Values,200; 300; 400; 500,400,Misleading Annotation,300,300,False,calvi/question49.png,23.641,"Answer: B
Explanation: Based on the chart, the average number of customers for the month of March is approximately 300. However, since the chart only shows data for January and March, we cannot determine the exact average number of customers from Jan to Mar. The average would be calculated by finding the arithmetic mean of the two values provided, which would be (Jan's value + March's value) divided by 2. In this case, the result is (500 + 300) / 2 = 400. However, since we are looking for an approximate average number, and considering that it may not be possible to calculate an exact average with only two data points, option B is selected as the answer. This choice reflects that the average number of customers in town X at mall A from Jan to Mar is approximately 300.

The other options do not match the information provided in the chart and are therefore not valid answers. Option A (200) is too low, option C (400) is higher than what we can conclude from the data provided, and option D (500) is also too high."
47,CALVI,More than half of the people in county Z prefer reading at night.,Pie chart,Make Comparisons,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Misleading Annotation,True.,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,calvi/question47.png,11.357,"Answer: B
Explanation: According to the pie chart, there are two options for preferred time of day for reading: morning or night. The chart indicates that 50% of people prefer reading at night and 50% prefer reading in the morning. So, it is incorrect to say more than half prefer reading at night, as the data shows an equal distribution between the two times of day. Option B is the correct answer because it accurately reflects the information presented on the chart."
11,CALVI,WY has a higher risk of bacteria Z infection than ND.,Choropleth Map,Make Comparisons,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,False,False,False,calvi/question11.png,14.850,"B. False

Explanation: The image shows a map with states color-coded by their level of risk for bacterium Z (BZ) infection, as well as the number of cases per million people in each state. Wyoming is colored red, indicating it has an elevated risk of BZ infection, while North Dakota is not shown on the map. Therefore, based on the information provided in the image, we cannot make a direct comparison between Wyoming and North Dakota regarding their relative risks of BZ infection. It would be more accurate to say that Wyoming has a higher risk of BZ infection compared to states with lower-risk color codes (like green or yellow)."

9,CALVI,"Approximately, what is brand C's total sales as a proportion of brand B's total sales from Jan 01 to Mar 15?",Stacked area chart,Make Comparisons,20%; 50%; 60%; 90%,60%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,20%,20%,False,calvi/question9.png,17.055,"Answer: A
Explanation: The image shows a line graph representing the total sales for three brands over a 4-month period from January to April. Brand C's total sales are approximately 20% of brand B's total sales during this time period, as indicated by the purple line on the graph and the label ""Brand C"" with its corresponding percentage on the right vertical axis. This is because the purple line for brand C is roughly at the bottom of the chart, representing a lower proportion than brand B, which has sales represented by the brown line that is higher up on the chart. Brand A's total sales are also shown in the graph but are not relevant to the question about brand C's proportion of sales relative to brand B."
5,CALVI,"On May 06 in city Z, what is the number of visitors at train station B as a proportion of that at train station C?",Stacked bar chart,Make Comparisons,25%; 33%; 75%; 100%,33%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,100%,33%,True,calvi/question5.png,17.676,"Answer: B
Explanation: The chart shows the number of visitors for each train station on May 06 in city Z. According to the chart, Train station C has 300 visitors, while Train station B has 400 visitors. To find out what proportion Train station B is of Train station C, you can divide the number of visitors at station B by the number of visitors at station C:

400 / 300 = 1.3333333

Since there are no other options that correspond to this value, the closest option to 1.33333333 is B. Therefore, Train station B has approximately 1.3 times as many visitors as Train station C on May 06 in city Z."
27,CALVI,GDP per capita for country Z grew faster from 2000 to 2003 than from 2005 to 2008.,Line chart,"Find Correlations/Trends, Make Comparisons",True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Use of Scale Functions,False,False,False,calvi/question27.png,14.821,"B.

Explanation: The chart shows that Brand B had the largest market share in 2001, with a value of 45, compared to its market share in the other years. In contrast, Brand A's market share decreased from 2001 to 2005, and Brand C's market share increased from 2003 to 2005 but was not as high as Brand B's market share in 2001. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: ""Brand B had the largest market share in 2001 compared to its market share in the other years."""

Too early to say.
Explanation: The image provided is a map showing the results of ice cream brand preferences in various states as of May 01, and it is mentioned that half of the votes have been counted so far. However, since only half of the votes have been tallied, it would not be accurate to determine which ice cream brand will be the most popular based on this snapshot alone. The results will change as more votes are counted from May 01 to May 15. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
6,CALVI,What is the trend for the percentage of bacteria Z from 1970 to 2020?,Line chart,Find Correlations/Trends,Generally increasing; Generally decreasing; Generally constant; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,"Cannot be inferred/inadequate information, Generally increasing",Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,Generally constant,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,calvi/question6.png,13.289,"Options:

There was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of the past 14 days.
Explanation: In the chart, there are five bars that represent the past 14 days of rainfall in millimeters. The first bar is the tallest, with a height just below 90 mm, indicating that there was more rainfall on the first day than on any other day. As we move along the timeline, the rainfall amounts decrease, with the remaining bars being shorter than the first one. Therefore, the statement ""There was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of the past 14 days"" is true based on the visual information provided in the chart. The other options are not supported by the data presented."

The question asks about the prevalence of plant species Y, and the options are:

A. It is more prevalent in region D than in E.
B. It is less prevalent in region B than in C.
C. It is more prevalent in region C than in A.
D. It is less prevalent in region C than in D.

To answer this question, we need to look at the colors on the map. The heat scale provided (ranging from very low to high) indicates the level of prevalence for plant species Y across different regions:

- Very Low: Light yellow
- Low: Yellow
- Moderate: Orange
- High: Red

Now, let's analyze each option and determine which one is correct based on the image:

A. It is more prevalent in region D than in E: From the map, it seems that plant species Y has a higher level of prevalence in region E (dark red) compared to region D (light orange). Therefore, the answer is A.

B. It is less prevalent in region B than in C: Looking at the map, it appears that plant species Y has a similar level of prevalence in regions B and C (both with a light orange color), indicating that B and C are equally populated, so option B is incorrect.

C. It is more prevalent in region C than in A: The image shows that plant species Y is less prevalent in region C (light orange) compared to region A (dark red). Therefore, option C is incorrect.

D. It is less prevalent in region C than in D: From the map, it's evident that plant species Y is more prevalent in region E (dark red) than in region C (light orange), so the answer is D.

Therefore, the correct option is D: It is less prevalent in region C than in D."

4,CALVI,What is the price of water bottle from store A as a proportion of that from store B?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,17%; 25%; 50%; 90%,90%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,17%,90%,True,calvi/question4.png,19.952,"Answer: D
Explanation: The image shows two water bottles, one from store A and the other from store B. The price of water bottle from store A is $2.17, while the price of water bottle from store B is $1.85. To find the proportion of store A's price to store B's price, we can divide the price of store A by the price of store B:

$2.17 / $1.85 = 1.17

Since this is greater than 1, it means that the price from store A is higher than the price from store B. However, to convert this into a percentage, we need to multiply by 100:

1.17 \* 100 = 117%

Therefore, the price of water bottle from store A as a proportion of that from store B is approximately 117%, which is option D."
