30,CALVI,Was the average amount of precipitation over 15 years in region D higher than that in region C?,Choropleth Map,Make Comparisons,Yes; No; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Missing Data,Yes,Yes,False,calvi/question30.png,14.519,"A. Yes
Explanation: The image shows a map with two different regions, labeled as C and D. Region C has an average amount of precipitation over 15 years that is lower than that of region D.
Select Option A, ""Yes"".
This conclusion can be drawn from the fact that the bar chart representing region C is significantly shorter than the one representing region D. Additionally, region D's average amount of precipitation is within the scale provided on the right side of the image, while region C's average amount of precipitation falls below this scale. This indicates that region D has higher average precipitation over 15 years compared to region C."
42,CALVI,"Which region has the highest number of confirmed cases per 1,000 people?",Choropleth Map,Make Comparisons,A; B; C; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Missing Normalization,B,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question42.png,12.063,"Answer: D
Explanation: The image provided does not show any numbers or specific regions. It is a map with different areas marked, but without numerical data it is not possible to determine which region has the highest number of confirmed cases per 1,000 people. The image only shows markings on the map, but there are no accompanying data or indicators that would allow us to compare and identify the specific regions with the highest number of confirmed cases per 1,000 people based solely on this visual representation."
8,CALVI,"Approximately, what is the total number of visitors at amusement park B as a proportion of that at amusement park C from May to December?",Stacked area chart,Make Comparisons,33%; 67%; 100%; 200%,33%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,200%,33%,True,calvi/question8.png,25.539,"Answer: A
Explanation: The chart shows the number of visitors for two amusement parks, B and C. To calculate the proportion of visitors at amusement park B as a proportion of that at amusement park C from May to December, we need to divide the total number of visitors at amusement park B by the total number of visitors at amusement park C during this time period.

In the chart:
- Amusement park A has 54,012 visitors in total.
- Amusement park B has 40,396 visitors in total.

So, we calculate the proportion as follows:
40,396 / 54,012 = 0.74358 (rounded to four decimal places)

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.74358 x 100 = 74.358%

Therefore, the correct answer is A: 33%. Amusement park B has about one-third of the visitors as that of amusement park C during the given time period. This is because the chart shows more visitors at amusement park C than at amusement park B for every month from May to December."
2,CALVI,Do U.S. states have a more similar number of windy days in the summer or in the winter?,Choropleth Map,Make Comparisons,Summer; Winter; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,Winter,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question2.png,7.750,"Answer: B
Explanation: The chart shows that the number of windy days is higher during the winter months than it is during the summer months, as indicated by a higher percentage of green states under the ""Winter"" column compared to the ""Summer"" column."
21,CALVI,"Assuming today is May 10 and given the chart below, which statement about rainfall (mm) is true for the past 14 days?",Bar chart,"Find Extremum, Make Comparisons",The amount of rainfall peaked at the end of the past 14 days.; There was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of the past 14 days.; None of the days had lower than 40mm of rainfall.; The amount of rainfall peaked at the beginning of the past 14 days.,There was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of the past 14 days.,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Order,The amount of rainfall peaked at the end of the past 14 days.,There was more rainfall at the beginning than at the end of the past 14 days.,True,calvi/question21.png,12.520,"Answer: B
Explanation: Based on the chart, the amount of rainfall starts high and decreases over time, with the lowest point at May 10th, which is today. This indicates that there was more rainfall at the beginning of the past 14 days than at the end.

A is not true because the peak of rainfall occurred earlier in the past 14 days, as evidenced by the chart. C and D are incorrect because they do not accurately represent the pattern of rainfall depicted in the graph."
20,CALVI,Which of the following is true about the prevalence of the plant species Y?,Choropleth Map,Make Comparisons,It is more prevalent in region D than in E.; It is less prevalent in region B than in C.; It is more prevalent in region C than in A.; It is less prevalent in region C than in D.,It is less prevalent in region C than in D.,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Order,It is more prevalent in region C than in A.,It is less prevalent in region B than in C.,False,calvi/question20.png,11.691,"Answer: B
Explanation: According to the map, the prevalence of the plant species Y is represented by the color scale ranging from white to red. In the legend on the right side, orange indicates a value of 1 and red indicates a value of 5. The map shows that region B has a lower concentration of this plant species (indicated by more white areas) compared to other regions, which means it is less prevalent in region B than in the other regions (C and D)."
35,CALVI,"Assuming today is Feb 20, 2022, which of the following is true about the vegetables planted by the three farms?",Stacked bar chart,Make Comparisons,All three farms planted more vegetables in 2022 than they did in the previous years.; All three farms planted fewer vegetables in 2022 than they did in the previous years.; All three farms planted about the same amount of vegetables in 2022 as they did in the previous years.; None of the above.,None of the above.,Inappropriate Aggregation,All three farms planted fewer vegetables in 2022 than they did in previous years.,All three farms planted more vegetables in 2022 than they did in the previous years.,False,calvi/question35.png,8.454,"Answer: B
Explanation: In the chart provided, it shows that each farm has a lower value for the number of vegetables planted in 2022 compared to the previous year. The bars for all three farms are shorter than the corresponding values from the previous year. Therefore, option B is true."
11,CALVI,WY has a higher risk of bacteria Z infection than ND.,Choropleth Map,Make Comparisons,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,False,False,False,calvi/question11.png,18.141,"B. False

Explanation: The image is a map showing the risk of bacterial infection by zip code within the United States. Each state has multiple zip codes, and each zip code is color-coded to indicate the level of risk. In this particular case, Wyoming (WY) does not appear to have a higher risk of bacterial infection Z in any of its zip codes compared to North Dakota (ND). The map indicates that ND has a slightly higher risk of infection in some areas when compared to WY, but overall there is no evidence to support the statement that WY has a higher risk of infection than ND. Therefore, option B, ""False,"" is the correct answer. Option A is not true because WY does not have a higher risk of infection as suggested, and option C is inadequate because it is based on incomplete or incorrect information."

Explanation: The line graph shows a consistently increasing trend in copies sold per year, with each year's sales figure being higher than the previous year's. Therefore, option C is correct as it describes the observed upward trajectory in the chart."
36,CALVI,"Assuming today is Apr 10, 2022, did the total number of cars parked in the three parking lots fall sharply in 2022?",Stacked bar chart,Make Comparisons,Yes; No; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Inappropriate Aggregation,Yes,Yes,False,calvi/question36.png,8.955,"Option A: Yes
Explanation: The image shows a line graph with data that indicates a significant drop in the number of cars parked in the three parking lots from January 2022 to April 10, 2022. This drop suggests that the total number of cars parked in these three lots fell sharply during this period."
9,CALVI,"Approximately, what is brand C's total sales as a proportion of brand B's total sales from Jan 01 to Mar 15?",Stacked area chart,Make Comparisons,20%; 50%; 60%; 90%,60%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,20%,20%,False,calvi/question9.png,21.437,"Option A: 20%

Explanation: In the image provided, Brand C's total sales from Jan 01 to Mar 15 amount to approximately $30,000, as indicated by the red line. Brand B's total sales from the same period are around $40,000, as shown by the purple line. To calculate the proportion of Brand C's total sales in comparison to Brand B's total sales, we divide the former by the latter: $30,000 / $40,000 ≈ 0.75. As a percentage, this is equal to 75%, but since the question asks for the proportion as a multiple choice answer and there is no option that directly represents 75% as a whole number, we will round to the nearest 10% for consistency with the provided options. Therefore, Brand C's total sales as a proportion of Brand B's total sales from Jan 01 to Mar 15 is approximately 20%."
52,CALVI,Monthly sales for store B is increasing from Jan to Dec.,Line chart,Find Correlations/Trends,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Misleading Annotation,True.,True,False,calvi/question52.png,12.174,"A. True

Explanation: The image shows a line graph representing monthly sales for stores A and B over a year, starting from January 2018. Store B's sales start at zero and increase steadily throughout the year, reaching its peak in December 2018. Store A's sales also increases, but it starts significantly higher than store B and remains higher throughout the entire period shown. Therefore, based on the chart, it is evident that store B's monthly sales for January to December are increasing."
38,CALVI,"Within each town, is there a negative relationship between average daily working hours and happiness score?",Scatterplot,Find Correlations/Trends,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Inappropriate Aggregation,True,False,True,calvi/question38.png,7.442,"Answer: A
Explanation: In the chart provided, we can observe that as the average daily working hours increase, the happiness score for both towns (A and B) decreases. This indicates a negative relationship between the two variables within each town."
10,CALVI,Predatory species Z is more prevalent in NC than in AZ.,Choropleth Map,Make Comparisons,True; False; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,True,False,True,calvi/question11.png,14.530,"B. False
Explanation: The image shows a map with colors indicating the risk of bacterinae infection in various states, and it's labeled as the ""Risk of Bacterinae Infection."" However, there is no specific label or data point that provides information about the presence or prevalence of predatory species Z in any given state, such as North Carolina (NC) or Arizona (AZ). The map is focused on bacterial infection risks and does not provide data on the distribution of predatory species. Therefore, it's impossible to determine if predatory species Z are more prevalent in NC than AZ based solely on this image."
50,CALVI,"In city Z, what is the approximate average number of new buildings built from 1950 to 1952?",Scatterplot,Aggregate Values,20; 30; 40; 50,40,Misleading Annotations,30,30,False,calvi/question50.png,15.634,"Answer: B
Explanation: The chart shows a bar for the number of new buildings in city Z from 1950 to 1952, and it is the tallest of all bars within that time period. Therefore, the approximate average number of new buildings built during this time would be 30.

Select option B: 30
Explanation: Since there is only one bar for the year range 1950 to 1952 and it is the tallest bar, it indicates that a large number of new buildings were constructed in city Z during this period, which would give an average of 30. The other options are not accurate based on the provided data in the chart."
49,CALVI,"In town X, what is the approximate average number of customers at mall A from Jan to Mar?",Bar chart,Aggregate Values,200; 300; 400; 500,400,Misleading Annotation,300,300,False,calvi/question49.png,12.350,"Answer: B
Explanation: The image shows a line graph with three bars representing the number of customers at Mall A from January to March, with the bars labeled as 800, 900, and 1200. To find the average number of customers for the period, you can add up all the numbers (800 + 900 + 1200) and divide by three. The result is approximately 300, which corresponds to option B in the multiple-choice question."
28,CALVI,Does cell phone brand A have more than half of the total market share?,Pie chart,Make Comparisons,Yes; No; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Use of Scale Functions,"Yes, No",Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question28.png,10.393,"Answer: B
Explanation: The chart shows that Cell Phone Brand Z has a market share of 50%, while Cell Phone Brand A has 48%. Therefore, Cell Phone Brand A does not have more than half of the total market share. It is important to note that this information is based solely on the data presented in the chart and does not take into account other cell phone brands or external factors that may affect market share."
40,CALVI,Does any members of species C weigh more than 5 lbs?,Scatterplot,Retrieve Value,Yes; No; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Overplotting,No,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question40.png,18.079,"Options:
A. Yes
B. No
C. Cannot be inferred/inadequate information

Explanation:
Answer: B

Reasoning:
From the image, it is evident that species A has all weights above 5 lbs while species B does not have any weight data below 5 lbs. There is only one instance where a member of species C weighs more than 5 lbs, which is at 9 lbs. Since there is just one outlier in species C that is heavier than 5 lbs, option A can be ruled out as an answer. Option B is the correct answer since no other members of species C are shown to weigh more than 5 lbs. Option C is not a valid answer because the image does provide information about the weights of species C, making it incorrect for this question."
29,CALVI,Are there more households with exactly 1 car than households with exactly 2 cars?,Pie chart,Make Comparisons,Yes; No; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Use of Scale Functions,"Yes, No",Yes,False,calvi/question29.png,16.936,"A. Yes

Explanation: The image shows a pie chart representing the number of households and the number of vehicles in a city, specifically focusing on household car ownership. According to the chart, 61% of households have exactly 1 car, while only 20% of households have exactly 2 cars. Therefore, there are more households with exactly 1 car than households with exactly 2 cars in this city. This is indicated by option A being the correct answer.

It's important to note that the chart does not provide information about households with more or fewer than 2 cars, so we can only make a comparison based on the given percentages. The other options (B and C) are incorrect as they do not accurately describe the data presented in the pie chart."
37,CALVI,"Assuming today is May 01, 2022, which of the following statements is true?",Area chart,"Find Correlations/Trends, Make Comparisons",Company Z had more new employees in 2018 than in 2020.; The number of new employees per year fell sharply in 2022.; The total number of employees in company Z decreased in 2022.; None of the above.,None of the above.,Inappropriate Aggregation,The number of new employees per year fell sharply in 2022.,The total number of employees in company Z decreased in 2022.,False,calvi/question37.png,11.374,"Answer: C. The total number of employees in company Z decreased in 2022.
Explanation: Based on the line graph provided, it shows a downward trend over the years, indicating that the total number of employees has decreased. This aligns with option C being true. A and B can be incorrect because the line graph does not show new employee numbers or a sharp decline in 2022, respectively. Option D is not possible without more information."
17,CALVI,What is the trend of the growth for plant species P as the number of hours of sunlight exposure per month increases?,Scatterplot,Find Correlations/Trends,Generally increases; Generally decreases; Generally constant; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Generally decreases,Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,Generally increaases,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,False,calvi/question17.png,11.923,"Option D: Cannot be inferred/inadequate information
Explanation: The image provided is a scatter plot showing the number of hours of sunlight exposure per month for plant species P against the number of growth for the same plant species. However, there isn't enough data or information available on the chart to draw any conclusions about the trend between sunlight and growth for plant species P. Since there are only three data points, it is not possible to accurately determine if the trend is increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant."

Explanation: In the provided image, the survival rate for species Z decreases as weight increases. This is indicated by the downward trend of the line graph, which starts at a higher survival rate and declines with increasing weight."
16,CALVI,Which is the trend of the total number of apples harvested in farm X from Jan 11 to Jan 14?,Area chart,Find Correlations/Trends,"Increasing, then decreasing; Decreasing, then increasing; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information","Decreasing, then increasing",Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,"Increasing, then decreasing","Increasing, then decreasing",False,calvi/question16.png,13.574,"Answer: A
Explanation: The chart shows a total number of apples harvested that starts off high on January 11 and then declines slightly on January 12 before a significant drop in the number of apples harvested on January 13. On January 14, there is a sharp increase in the number of apples harvested. This pattern suggests an increasing trend initially, followed by a decline, and then another increase.

Please note that this analysis is based on the information available from the image and does not take into account any external context or factors that may have influenced the harvest data."
1,CALVI,Do U.S. states have a more similar number of sunny days in the summer or in the winter?,Choropleth Map,Make Comparisons,Summer; Winter; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,Summer,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question1.png,11.796,"Answer: A
Explanation: The image shows two charts, one for summer and one for winter, with each chart having red and blue bars indicating the number of sunny days per month across various states. The blue bars in both charts indicate a lower count of sunny days compared to the red bars, suggesting that the red color represents more sunny days than the blue color in both seasons. Thus, option A is correct as it correctly identifies summer as having more sunny days across the states shown on the chart."
26,CALVI,"Approximately, what is the number of votes for candidate A as a proportion of those for candidate B?",Bar chart,Make Comparisons,50%; 60%; 70%; 80%,80%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Use of Scale Functions,50%,60%,False,calvi/question26.png,11.911,"Answer: B
Explanation: In the image, candidate A received 3 votes while candidate B received 2 votes. To find out what the proportion of votes for candidate A is compared to those for candidate B, we need to divide the number of votes for candidate A by the total number of votes (which is 5 in this case). This gives us:
3 / 5 = 0.6, or 60% as a percentage. Therefore, option B is correct.
Select your answer: B"
43,CALVI,What is the trend sales in gift shop A from Jan to Dec?,Line chart,Find Correlations/Trends,Generally increasing; Generally decreasing; Generally constant; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cherry Picking,Generally increasing,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question43.png,10.075,"Answer: B
Explanation: The image shows a graph with the title ""Sales over time in gift shop A"". The line on the graph is generally decreasing, as it starts at a high point and declines over time until it reaches a low point at the end. This suggests that sales in gift shop A are not increasing or constant, but rather decreasing during the period shown in the chart."
15,CALVI,What is the trend of the total sales for item X from Apr to Jul?,Line chart,Find Correlations/Trends,"Decreasing, then increasing; Increasing, then decreasing; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information","Increasing, then decreasing",Manipulation of Scales - Unconventional Scale Directions,"Decreasing, then increasing","Decreasing, then increasing",False,calvi/question15.png,14.158,"A. Decreasing, then increasing

Explanation: The chart shows a graph of total sales for item X over the past four months from April to July. The x-axis represents the number of months, while the y-axis represents the total sales in thousands of dollars. Looking at the graph, we can observe that there is an initial decrease in sales during April and May, followed by a significant increase in June and then a small drop in sales during July. Based on this visual analysis, option A, ""Decreasing, then increasing,"" best describes the trend of the total sales for item X from April to July as depicted on the graph."
4,CALVI,What is the price of water bottle from store A as a proportion of that from store B?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,17%; 25%; 50%; 90%,90%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,17%,90%,True,calvi/question4.png,24.623,"Answer: D
Explanation: In the image, the price of water bottle in store A is $0.20 and in store B it's $0.40. To find the proportion of price from store A to that from store B, you need to divide the price in store A by the price in store B. So, $0.20 ÷ $0.40 = 0.5 or 50%. Therefore, option C is incorrect. The correct answer is D, which states that the price of water bottle from store A is 90% of that from store B. This is because if we divide the price of water in store A by the price in store B, it would be 0.20 / 0.40 = 0.5, but since option D lists the percentage as a multiple of ten, it's rounded to 90%.

However, this is an error in the question as it should be 17% (0.20/0.40) and not 90%. The image provided does not represent the actual price proportions between stores A and B. It only shows that store A sells water bottles for a lower price than store B."
3,CALVI,What is the number of concert tickets sold on Aug 10 as a proportion of that on Aug 11?,Bar chart,Make Comparisons,20%; 40%; 60%; 80%,80%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,60%,20%,False,calvi/question3.png,14.525,"Answer: A
Explanation: The image shows that there were 200 concert tickets sold on August 10, and 800 concert tickets sold on August 11. To find the proportion of concert tickets sold on Aug 10 compared to Aug 11, we need to divide the number of tickets sold on Aug 10 by the number of tickets sold on Aug 11:
200 / 800 = 0.25 or 25%. Therefore, the number of concert tickets sold on Aug 10 as a proportion of that on Aug 11 is 25%, which is option A."

39,CALVI,"Within each city, is there a positive relationship between salary and average daily working hours?",Scatterplot,Find Correlations/Trends,Yes; No; Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,Inappropriate Aggregation,Yes,Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,True,calvi/question39.png,24.322,"Option A, ""Yes,"" is the best answer based on the image provided. The chart shows a scatter plot with salary on the y-axis and average daily working hours on the x-axis for three cities: Philadelphia, Chicago, and Washington DC. From this, one can observe that as the salary increases in each city, there is an upward trend in the average daily working hours. This indicates a positive relationship between salary and average daily working hours within each of the three cities displayed in the chart.

Answer: A
Explanation: The chart presents data points for Philadelphia, Chicago, and Washington DC, showing that as salary increases, there is an increase in the average daily working hours for each city. This suggests a positive relationship between salary and average daily working hours within each city. Therefore, option A, ""Yes,"" is the correct answer.

B and C are not accurate, as they do not reflect the observed trend in the data points. Option B, ""No,"" would be incorrect because there is indeed a positive relationship evident in the chart. Option C, ""Cannot be inferred/inadequate information,"" is also incorrect because the chart does provide enough information to conclude that there is a positive relationship between salary and average daily working hours within each city."

Explanation: The chart shows a line graph with the title ""Number of New Movies Released Annually in City X"" and displays data for various years. Based on the graph, it is clear that the year 2000 had the highest number of new movies released, which is consistent with option B. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 2000 had the most number of new movies released. Option A is incorrect because there were fewer new movies released in 1992 than in 1994. Option C is also incorrect because there were more new movies released in 1995 than in 1996. The year 1994 had the second highest number of new movies released, not 1996 as indicated by option C. Option D is not a valid answer based on the options provided."

However, the chart does not provide any information about what happens to the bottles sold when the temperature exceeds 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately determine if the bottle sales would continue to increase or decrease at higher temperatures without additional data or context."

Explanation: In the image, there are three different company ratings shown on the chart. Company Z has an employee satisfaction rating of 4.5, while company A has a satisfaction rating of 3 and company D has a satisfaction rating of 5. Since the satisfaction rating at B is higher than that at C (which is only 1), it can be concluded that more employees have a satisfaction rating at B compared to those at C. None of the other statements are accurately represented by the chart provided."
5,CALVI,"On May 06 in city Z, what is the number of visitors at train station B as a proportion of that at train station C?",Stacked bar chart,Make Comparisons,25%; 33%; 75%; 100%,33%,Manipulation of Scales - Inappropriate Scale Range,100%,33%,True,calvi/question5.png,15.242,"Answer: B
Explanation: The image shows three bar graphs, representing the number of visitors at a train station in city Z on May 06 over a four day period. To determine the proportion of visitors at train station B to that at train station C, we need to compare the heights of the bars corresponding to those stations. From the graph, it is clear that train station B had approximately three times as many visitors as train station C on May 06. Therefore, the proportion of visitors at station B compared to station C would be about 3:1, or 33.3% (rounded to one decimal place). Option B is closest to this value, so it is the correct answer."
