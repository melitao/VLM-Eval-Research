Explanation: The graph shows a line that starts at just above $60 and then drops quickly to around $45, before leveling out. This suggests that the price of oil fell significantly during the time period shown, which is April to September in 2015. Therefore, option B, ""$15"", is not correct as it is too low a decrease. Option C, ""$17"", is also too high. The remaining options, A and D, are more accurate but they both fall outside the range indicated by the graph. Thus, the best answer is B, with an explanation that while $45 is not the exact value shown on the graph, it does indicate a significant drop in oil prices from April to September 2015."

21,VLAT,How many people have rated the taxi between 4.0 and 4.2?,Histogram,Retrieve Value (derived value),145; 153; 200; 240; Omit,153,153,True,vlat/Histogram.png,17.714,"Answer: B
Explanation: Based on the chart, there are two bars with heights between 4.0 and 4.2. The first bar is at a height of 153, which corresponds to the value of 4.1 for the taxi rating. The second bar is partially above and below this height but does not fully overlap any other bars. The height of this bar can be estimated by calculating the difference in heights between the top of the second bar and the bottom of the first bar, which is approximately 200 - 153 = 47. However, this value is not represented on the chart. Therefore, we can conclude that there are 153 people who rated the taxi a 4.1. The options provided do not match the actual value, and the correct answer is B."

Explanation: Based on the scatter plot, it seems that there is a positive linear relationship between the height and weight of the 85 males. The data points tend to follow an upward trend as we move from left to right along the x-axis, indicating that as the height increases, so does the weight. Therefore, option B is correct because there is not a negative linear relationship between height and weight in this case. Option A is false for this reason."

The left-hand side of the chart lists various factors such as population size and train frequency, but it does not provide information about the total number of stations or the length of the system. Therefore, it is impossible to determine from this chart whether there are approximately 300 stations in these metro systems with a system length of around 200 km. The chart is focused on comparing various factors among different cities and does not provide specific data about the number of stations or system lengths."
