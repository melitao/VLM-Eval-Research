Options:
A. True
B. False
C. Omit

Explanation: The image shows a pie chart representing the number of baby girls named Olivia, Isla, and two other names in the UK for three years: 2010, 2014, and 2017. According to the legend on the right side of the image, one color represents Olivia, another represents Isla, and so on. To determine the ratio of the number of girls named Olivia to those named Isla in 2014, we can look at the corresponding segments of the pie chart for each name. In 2014, there are two segments representing Olivia, which occupy approximately one-third of the pie chart's area. In contrast, there is only a single segment representing Isla, occupying about one-sixth of the area. Therefore, the ratio of the number of girls named Olivia to those named Isla in 2014 would be approximately 3 to 1, or 3:1. This corresponds to option C."

Explanation: In the given image, there are multiple data points represented by blue dots on a scatter plot, which represent the heights and weights of males in a given population. The question asks whether all the weight measurements for males with the height of 188 cm are the same. While it is common to assume that data points on a scatter plot are connected by lines or lines connecting them, the chart does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether the weights of all males who are 188 cm tall are exactly the same. The image only shows two weight measurements for individuals who are 188 cm tall, and it is possible that these two data points are anomalies or outliers. Therefore, the best answer based on the given chart is option B: False."

11,VLAT,About what is the ratio of the cost of a sandwich to the total cost of room service in Seattle?,Stacked Bar chart,Retrieve Value (relative value),1 to 10; 2 to 10; 4 to 10; 6 to 10; Omit,4 to 10,2 to 10,False,vlat/StackedBarChart.png,45.732,"Answer: B
Explanation: The image shows a bar graph that compares the cost of food items to the total cost of room service in Seattle. The bars representing food items are colorful and include sandwiches, salads, breakfast items, and dinner items. Each bar is proportioned according to its corresponding value.

The ratio of the cost of a sandwich to the total cost of room service can be calculated by finding the height of the sandwich bar and dividing it by the sum of the heights of all bars representing food items (sandwiches, salads, breakfast items, dinner items). The total cost of room service is represented by the line graph on the right side of the image.

To calculate the ratio:
1. Determine the height of the sandwich bar.
2. Find the sum of the heights of all bars representing food items (sandwiches, salads, breakfast items, dinner items).
3. Divide the height of the sandwich bar by the sum of the heights of all food item bars.

Looking at the image, we can see that the tallest bar among the food items is for sandwiches. By measuring the height of this bar and the total cost of room service, which is represented by the line graph on the right side of the image, we can calculate the ratio of the cost of a sandwich to the total cost of room service as follows:

Height of the sandwich bar = 7
Total height of all food item bars = 26 (sandwiches, salads, breakfast items, dinner items)

So the ratio of the cost of a sandwich to the total cost of room service is:
7 / 26 = 0.26923

However, this answer does not match any of the provided options. Therefore, the correct answer should be:
E. Omit

The options provided (A to D) are incorrect and do not represent the actual ratio of the cost of a sandwich to the total cost of room service in Seattle as shown on the image."

Explanation: The chart in the image shows data for internet speeds, with bars representing different regions such as Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. In the region represented by Asia, there is a peak of the bar indicating the highest internet speed, which is approximately 17 Mbps. Based on this information, the range of the average internet speed in Asia can be calculated using the formula:

Range = Highest value - Lowest value

However, as the image does not provide enough information to determine the lowest internet speed in Asia, the correct answer is Omit."

Explanation: To calculate the range of weight for the 85 males, you would subtract the minimum value from the maximum value. On the chart, the minimum weight for the 85 males is 62.3 kg and the maximum weight is 90.9 kg. Therefore, the range is 90.9 - 62.3 = 28.6 kg. However, since ""A"" and ""C"" both have ranges that are lower than this calculated range, they can be ruled out. Option ""D"" has a range that is higher than the calculated range, so it can also be ruled out. Therefore, the correct answer is ""B""."
