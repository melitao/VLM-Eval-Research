Explanation: In the image provided, it shows a line graph with the price of coffee beans over time. The horizontal axis represents the month of the year, and the vertical axis indicates the average price per pound. To find the average price in September 2013, we need to look for the data point on the line graph that corresponds to that particular month. In September 2013, the data point is $5.0 on the vertical axis, which suggests an average price of $5.0 per pound of coffee beans during that month. Option B, $5.0, is the correct answer based on the information provided in the chart.

Note: The other options listed (A, C, and D) do not correspond to the actual average price for coffee beans in September 2013 as shown in the image.

11,VLAT,About what is the ratio of the cost of a sandwich to the total cost of room service in Seattle?,Stacked Bar chart,Retrieve Value (relative value),1 to 10; 2 to 10; 4 to 10; 6 to 10; Omit,4 to 10,6 to 10,FALSE,vlat/StackedBarChart.png,22.487,"Answer: D
Explanation: Based on the chart, the total cost of room service in Seattle is $35, and the cost of a sandwich is $5. To find the ratio of the cost of a sandwich to the total cost of room service, we can use the formula Ratio = Part / Whole = Sandwich / Room Service. Plugging in the values: Ratio = 5/35. Simplifying the fraction gives us 1/7, which is approximately equal to 0.14. So, the ratio of the cost of a sandwich to the total cost of room service in Seattle is around 1/7 or 0.14. Option D, which is 6 to 10, is not correct based on the information provided in the chart. Therefore, option D is not an accurate representation of the ratio and can be eliminated from consideration. The remaining options A, B, and C do not provide an accurate description of the ratio as given by the chart, so option E (Omit) would be the best answer since there is no correct representation of the ratio among the given options."
28,VLAT,A group of males are gathered aroud the height of 176 cm and the weight of 70 kg.,Scatterplot,Find Clusters,True; False; Omit,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,vlat/Scatterplot.png,13.258,"Answer: B
Explanation: The image does not provide any information about the relationship between height and weight. It only shows a scatter plot with dots representing data points for some variable, but it is not specified which variables those dots represent. Since we are being asked to identify a group of males, it is likely that the x-axis represents height in cm and the y-axis represents weight in kg, but without explicit labels on the axes or an accompanying legend, it is impossible to determine if the data points shown on the chart relate to males specifically. Thus, option B is the best answer."
24,VLAT,What is the weight for the person who is 165.1 cm tall?,Scatterplot,Retrieve Value,53.9 kg; 67.7 kg; 70.5 kg; 82.7 kg; Omit,70.5 kg,53.9 kg,FALSE,vlat/Scatterplot.png,8.318,"Answer: A
Explanation: The weight for the person who is 165.1 cm tall on this chart is approximately 53.9 kg, which falls under option A. This is because the dot representing the weight for a person at that height is located around the number ""54"", which corresponds to the weight range from 52 to 55 kg."

Explanation: The image shows a bar graph with data related to metro systems in various cities, including their length and the number of trains. To calculate the range of total length of the metro systems, we need to consider all the city metro system lengths shown on the graph. The shortest length is 150 km (which is for one of the metro systems) and the longest length is 600 km. Therefore, the range of the total length of the metro systems would be from 150 to 600 km. Option C, ""240 - 560 km,"" is not correct because it does not encompass the entire range shown on the graph."

Since there are no specific heights labeled on the axes and we can only see the position of the dots relative to the heights on the chart, I cannot determine an exact number for each person's height. However, based on the visible information, we can say that there is one dot with a height above all the others, so it would be considered as ""outside the others the most.""

Answer: D. 197.1 cm
Explanation: The tallest point shown in the image has a height of approximately 197 centimeters, which is beyond the range indicated by the other dots. Therefore, the dot representing this height can be considered to lie outside the others."

Explanation: Based on the chart, the weight for males with a height of 188 cm is not the same. There are several different weights shown in the chart for males at that height. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Since there is variation in the data for males at 188 cm, and the image does not provide any information about what the weights should be (as they vary), option C is also incorrect. Thus, the correct answer is B. False. The chart shows that males of that height have different weights."
