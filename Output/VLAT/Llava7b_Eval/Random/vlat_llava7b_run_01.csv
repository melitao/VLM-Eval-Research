Explanation: In the image, we see a chart with two variables represented by their coordinates on the X and Y axes. The weight is represented along the vertical axis (Y-axis), ranging from 0 to 100. To find the weight for someone who is 165.1 cm tall, we need to locate the point on the graph that corresponds to that height. We can do this by looking at the horizontal axis (X-axis) to find the position of 165.1 cm and then following a straight line up from that point until we reach the Y-axis. From there, we can read off the weight.

The person who is 165.1 cm tall is located at approximately X = 7.4 on the X-axis. Following the straight line from this point up to the Y-axis, the weight for someone 165.1 cm tall would be approximately 53.9 kg. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
