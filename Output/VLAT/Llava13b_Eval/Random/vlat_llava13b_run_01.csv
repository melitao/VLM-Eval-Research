Based on the colors visible in the image, it seems that the highest unemployment rate in 2015 was in New Mexico (NM), as indicated by the most saturated blue color on the map. Therefore, the answer to the question is:

Answer: B. New Mexico (NM)
Explanation: The image provides a visual representation of unemployment rates across the United States, with the states highlighted in blue corresponding to higher unemployment rates. The state with the highest unemployment rate as indicated by the brightest blue color is New Mexico (NM)."

44,VLAT,Which city/’s metro system does lie outside the relationship between the total system length and the number of stations most?,BubbleChart,Find Anomalies,Tokyo; New York City; Beijing; London; Omit,New York City,Tokyo,False,vlat/BubbleChart.png,60.162,"Explanation: The chart shows a positive correlation between the total system length and the number of stations for cities that have metro systems. This means that as the total system length increases, the number of stations typically also increases. To find the city/metro system that lies outside this relationship, we need to look for a point on the graph where the number of stations remains relatively constant or decreases while the total system length increases significantly.

Looking at the chart, Tokyo's metro system shows such an anomaly. The blue dots representing Tokyo's data indicate that even as the total system length increases from around 65 to approximately 210 kilometers, the number of stations remains relatively constant at around 147. This deviation from the general trend suggests that Tokyo's metro system lies outside the relationship between total system length and the number of stations in this specific data set.

Answer: A. Tokyo"

Explanation: The chart shows a diagram of the Beijing metro system with multiple lines and stations connected to each other, indicating its expansive network. Based on the visible lines in the image, it appears that the total length is significantly over 300 km, which aligns with option A's ""330 km"". The presence of numerous dots suggests a dense network within the metro system, and the scale of the map shows its extensive coverage. Option B (400 km) seems unrealistic based on the visible lines, while options C (530 km) and D (560 km) are not depicted in the visible part of the diagram and would likely be overestimations. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: ""330 km""."

Explanation: The chart shows a scatter plot of weight vs. height for a group of males and females, with the weights ranging from 40 to 130 kg. The 85 males are represented by blue dots on this graph. In order to determine their range in weight based solely on the visual information provided, we can observe that the lightest male is on the left side of the image and the heaviest is on the right side. Given these observations, we can confidently conclude that the weight range for the 85 males lies between 40 and 130 kg. The exact middle point, at which the lightest and heaviest males are located horizontally, would be approximately 78.2 kg. However, this would fall within both options A and B, so option A is more appropriate as it includes all weights represented by blue dots on the chart."
