Explanation: The weight for the person who is 165.1 cm tall can be calculated by multiplying the height in centimeters by a conversion factor to convert it to kilograms (1 kg = approximately 0.59 m). Thus, the weight would be approximately 117.2 kg if converted directly from centimeters to kilograms. However, since the image shows weights in kilograms and heights in centimeters, we should look for the corresponding value. The chart lists people of different heights in centimeters and their corresponding weights in kilograms. Therefore, based on the chart's numerical values, the person who is 165.1 cm tall corresponds to a weight of 82.7 kg."

The vertical axis indicates that each point represents $1 increase or decrease from the previous point on the graph.

Looking at the September 2013 line, it shows a slight increase in the first part of the month and then a significant drop towards the end of the month. Therefore, the average price during September 2013 would be located approximately between the peak of the first increase and the trough of the decrease, as there was not much time for the price to recover or change significantly after the decrease.

Based on this reasoning, the best answer is: B. $5.0."
