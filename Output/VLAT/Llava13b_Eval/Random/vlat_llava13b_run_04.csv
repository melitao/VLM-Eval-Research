From this information, we can determine that there are people who have rated the taxi between 4.0 and 4.2 stars.

Answer: C
Explanation: In the provided chart, several ratings of 4.1 are visible, as well as one at 4.0 and two at 4.2. To calculate the number of people who have rated between 4.0 and 4.2, we would count those individuals whose rating is within this range. In this case, there are six ratings that fall within this range: 1 x 4.0, 5 x 4.1, and 1 x 4.2. Therefore, the number of people who have rated between 4.0 and 4.2 stars is 6, not 145 or any other multiple of 6.

Please note that without further context or an ability to count all the visible ratings in the image, this analysis is based solely on what can be directly observed in the chart provided."

False
Explanation: In the provided chart, the approval rating for ""Postgraduate Study"" is shown as a series of blue bars and red bars with the highest point being marked in gray. The approval rating for ""Some College Degree"" is represented by two different sets of colored bars; one with blue bars and the other with orange bars. The lowest point on both education levels is highlighted with a gray background, suggesting that both groups have similar low approval ratings at their lowest points. However, it can be observed that the ""Some College Degree"" group has higher peaks in the orange bars compared to the blue bars of the ""Postgraduate Study"" group, indicating that this specific education level has a higher approval rating for Republicans at those times. Therefore, the statement is false."

Answer: 53.9 - 102.3 kg
Explanation: The image shows a histogram with bars representing the weight range for males within an age group and gender. The bars are clustered around the center, indicating that there is a relatively narrow range of weights. Given this visual information, it seems more likely that the actual range of weight for the 85 males would be relatively narrow, as indicated by the concentration of bars near the mean or median value. Therefore, the correct answer is the option with the narrowest range: C."
