Explanation:
Looking at the chart, Thailand's internet speed is approximately 27. Thailand is faster than: China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Vietnam. Therefore, 6 countries have a slower internet speed than Thailand.

However, after looking at the question again, it says ""How many countries in Asia?"". New Zealand is not in Asia. So, we need to exclude New Zealand.
Thailand is faster than: China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. 
Therefore, 5 countries.

I made a mistake in the previous attempt. Let me review the options. 
Thailand is faster than: China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. 
Therefore, 5 countries in Asia are slower than Thailand.

Upon review, I can see that Sri Lanka is slower than Thailand. So, we must add Sri Lanka to the list.

Therefore, Thailand is faster than: China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. Therefore, 6 countries in Asia are slower than Thailand.

I realize that I must now review the chart once more, and be absolutely certain. It appears that I missed Japan. It is in fact slower than Thailand. So, now the list is: China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Japan.

Therefore, 7 countries are slower than Thailand."
