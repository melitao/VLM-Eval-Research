The graph is titled ""Temperature vs Bottles of Water Sold.""

To answer the question, we need to look at the data presented in the graph:

1. At 100 degrees Fahrenheit, there are approximately 750 bottles of water sold.
2. As the temperature increases, the number of bottles sold also increases.
3. The line representing the number of bottles sold is generally upward sloping, indicating that as the temperature rises, more bottles of water are sold.
4. However, there is a slight dip in the number of bottles sold just above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, but it's not significant enough to suggest that fewer bottles are sold at higher temperatures.

Based on this information, the correct answer is:

A) If the temperature gets higher than 100 degree Fahrenheit, then the bottles of water sold must be greater than 750.

This is because the graph shows a general trend where as the temperature increases, more bottles of water are sold, and at 100 degrees Fahrenheit, there are approximately 750 bottles sold. Therefore, if the temperature were to increase further, it would be reasonable to assume that the number of bottles sold would also increase, not decrease. ",

The visualization shows a bar chart with three bars representing different hiking trails: Trail A, Trail B, and Trail C. The x-axis represents the number of votes, ranging from 0 to 1200 votes. The y-axis represents the percentage of votes received by each trail.

From the visualization, we can observe that as the number of votes increases, the percentage of votes for Trail A decreases, while the percentage of votes for Trail B and Trail C increases. This trend suggests that Trail A is receiving fewer votes compared to Trails B and C as more votes are counted.

Given this information, the correct answer to the question is:

A) The poll closes on Sep 01, 2022.

The other options do not provide any relevant information about the visualization or the context of the hiking trail vote. Therefore, option A is the only one that can be determined as correct based on the visualization provided. ",

The graph is titled ""Temperature vs Bottles of Water Sold.""

To answer the question, we need to look at the data presented in the graph:

1. At 100 degrees Fahrenheit, there are approximately 750 bottles of water sold.
2. As the temperature increases, the number of bottles sold also increases.
3. The line representing the number of bottles sold is generally upward sloping, indicating that as the temperature rises, more bottles of water are sold.
4. However, there is a slight dip in the number of bottles sold just above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, but it's not significant enough to suggest that fewer bottles are sold at higher temperatures.

Based on this information, the correct answer is:

A) If the temperature gets higher than 100 degree Fahrenheit, then the bottles of water sold must be greater than 750.

This is because the graph shows a general trend where as the temperature increases, more bottles of water are sold, and at 100 degrees Fahrenheit, there are approximately 750 bottles sold. Therefore, if the temperature were to increase further, it would be reasonable to assume that the number of bottles sold would also increase, not decrease. ",
